Gen 2:4 These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made]
Gen 2:5 In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth[ and no grass had come up: for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land]
Gen 2:6 But a mist went up from the earth[ watering all the face of the land]
Gen 2:7 And the Lord God made man from the dust of the earth[ breathing into him the breath of life: and man became a living soul]
Gen 2:8 And the Lord God made a garden in the east[ in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had made]
Gen 2:9 And out of the earth the Lord made every tree to come[ delighting the eye and good for food; and in the middle of the garden[ the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil]
Gen 2:10 And a river went out of Eden giving water to the garden; and from there it was parted and became four streams]
Gen 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon[ which goes round about all the land of Havilah where there is gold]
Gen 2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone]
Gen 2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: this river goes round all the land of Cush]
Gen 2:14 And the name of the third river is Tigris[ which goes to the east of Assyria] And the fourth river is Euphrates]
Gen 2:15 And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to do work in it and take care of it]
Gen 2:16 And the Lord God gave the man orders[ saying[ You may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden:
Gen 2:17 But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it[ death will certainly come to you]
Gen 2:18 And the Lord God said[ It is not good for the man to be by himself: I will make one like himself as a help to him
Gen 2:19 And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air[ and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing[ that was its name]
Gen 2:20 And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help]
Gen 2:21 And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man[ and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping[ joining up the flesh again in its place:
Gen 2:22 And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman[ and took her to the man]
Gen 2:23 And the man said[ This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man]
Gen 2:24 For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh]
Gen 2:25 And the man and his wife were without clothing[ and they had no sense of shame]
Gen 3:1 Now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made] And he said to the woman[ Has God truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden&
Gen 3:2 And the woman said[ We may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden:
Gen 3:3 But of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden[ God has said[ If you take of it or put your hands on it[ death will come to you]
Gen 3:4 And the snake said[ Death will not certainly come to you:
Gen 3:5 For God sees that on the day when you take of its fruit[ your eyes will be open[ and you will be as gods[ having knowledge of good and evil]
Gen 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food[ and a delight to the eyes[ and to be desired to make one wise[ she took of its fruit[ and gave it to her husband]
Gen 3:7 And their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together]
Gen 3:8 And there came to them the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening wind: and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden[ away from the eyes of the Lord God]
Gen 3:9 And the voice of the Lord God came to the man[ saying[ Where are you&
Gen 3:10 And he said[ Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear[ because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes]
Gen 3:11 And he said[ Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing& Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take&
Gen 3:12 And the man said[ The woman whom you gave to be with me[ she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it]
Gen 3:13 And the Lord God said to the woman[ What have you done& And the woman said[ I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it]
Gen 3:14 And the Lord God said to the snake[ Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth[ and dust will be your food all the days of your life:
Gen 3:15 And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded]
Gen 3:16 To the woman he said[ Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband[ but he will be your master]
Gen 3:17 And to Adam he said[ Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take[ the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life]
Gen 3:18 Thorns and waste plants will come up[ and the plants of the field will be your food;
Gen 3:19 With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back]
Gen 3:20 And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life]
Gen 3:21 And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing]
Gen 3:22 And the Lord God said[ Now the man has become like one of us[ having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life[ he will go on living for ever]
Gen 3:23 So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken]
Gen 3:24 So he sent the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life]
Gen 4:1 And the man had connection with Eve his wife[ and she became with child and gave birth to Cain[ and said[ I have got a man from the Lord]
Gen 4:2 Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel[ his brother] And Abel was a keeper of sheep[ but Cain was a farmer]
Gen 4:3 And after a time[ Cain gave to the Lord an offering of the fruits of the earth]
Gen 4:4 And Abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat] And the Lord was pleased with Abel{s offering;
Gen 4:5 But in Cain and his offering he had no pleasure] And Cain was angry and his face became sad]
Gen 4:6 And the Lord said to Cain[ Why are you angry& and why is your face sad&
Gen 4:7 If you do well[ will you not have honour& and if you do wrong[ sin is waiting at the door[ desiring to have you[ but do not let it be your master]
Gen 4:8 And Cain said to his brother[ Let us go into the field: and when they were in the field[ Cain made an attack on his brother Abel and put him to death]
Gen 4:9 And the Lord said to Cain[ Where is your brother Abel& And he said[ I have no idea: am I my brother{s keeper&
Gen 4:10 And he said[ What have you done& the voice of your brother{s blood is crying to me from the earth]
Gen 4:11 And now you are cursed from the earth[ whose mouth is open to take your brother{s blood from your hand;
Gen 4:12 No longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work; you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth]
Gen 4:13 And Cain said[ My punishment is greater than my strength]
Gen 4:14 You have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face; I will be a wanderer in flight over the earth[ and whoever sees me will put me to death]
Gen 4:15 And the Lord said[ Truly[ if Cain is put to death[ seven lives will be taken for his] And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one might put him to death]
Gen 4:16 And Cain went away from before the face of the Lord[ and made his living-place in the land of Nod on the east of Eden]
Gen 4:17 And Cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to Enoch: and he made a town[ and gave the town the name of Enoch after his son]
Gen 4:18 And Enoch had a son Irad: and Irad became the father of Mehujael: and Mehujael became the father of Methushael: and Methushael became the father of Lamech]

Gen 4:22 And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain[ who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah]
Gen 4:23 And Lamech said to his wives[ Adah and Zillah[ give ear to my voice; you wives of Lamech[ give attention to my words[ for I would put a man to death for a wound[ and a young man for a blow;
Gen 4:24 If seven lives are to be taken as punishment for Cain{s death[ seventy-seven will be taken for Lamech{s]
Gen 4:25 And Adam had connection with his wife again[ and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of Seth: for she said[ God has given me another seed in place of Abel[ whom Cain put to death]

Gen 7:10 And after the seven days[ the waters came over all the earth]
Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah{s life[ in the second month[ on the seventeenth day of the month[ all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through[ and the windows of heaven were open;
Gen 7:12 And rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights]

Gen 7:14 And with them[ every sort of beast and cattle[ and every sort of thing which goes on the earth[ and every sort of bird]
Gen 7:15 They went with Noah into the ark[ two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life]
Gen 7:16 Male and female of all flesh went in[ as God had said[ and the ark was shut by the Lord]
Gen 7:17 And for forty days the waters were over all the earth; and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth]
Gen 7:18 And the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth[ and the ark was resting on the face of the waters]
Gen 7:19 And the waters overcame everything on the earth; and all the mountains under heaven were covered]
Gen 7:20 The waters went fifteen cubits higher[ till all the mountains were covered]
Gen 7:21 And destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth[ birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth[ and every man]
Gen 7:22 Everything on the dry land[ in which was the breath of life[ came to its end]
Gen 7:23 Every living thing on the face of all the earth[ man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth[ and birds of the air[ came to destruction: only Noah and those who were with him in the ark[ were kept from death]
Gen 7:24 And the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days]
Gen 8:1 And God kept Noah in mind[ and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth[ and the waters went down]
Gen 8:2 And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut[ and the rain from heaven was stopped]
Gen 8:3 And the waters went slowly back from the earth[ and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower]
Gen 8:4 And on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat]
Gen 8:5 And still the waters went on falling[ till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen]
Gen 8:6 Then[ after forty days[ through the open window of the ark which he had made[
Gen 8:7 Noah sent out a raven[ which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth]
Gen 8:8 And he sent out a dove[ to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth;
Gen 8:9 But the dove saw no resting-place for her foot[ and came back to the ark[ for the waters were still over all the earth; and he put out his hand[ and took her into the ark]
Gen 8:10 And after waiting another seven days[ he sent the dove out again;
Gen 8:11 And the dove came back at evening[ and in her mouth was an olive-leaf broken off: so Noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth]
Gen 8:12 And after seven days more[ he sent the dove out again[ but she did not come back to him]
Gen 8:13 And in the six hundred and first year[ on the first day of the first month[ the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry]
Gen 8:14 And on the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was dry]
Gen 8:15 And God said to Noah[
Gen 8:16 Go out of the ark[ you and your wife and your sons and your sons{ wives]
Gen 8:17 Take out with you every living thing which is with you[ birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth[ so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth]
Gen 8:18 And Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons{ wives;
Gen 8:19 And every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth[ went out of the ark]
Gen 8:20 And Noah made an altar to the Lord[ and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar]
Gen 8:21 And when the sweet smell came up to the Lord[ he said in his heart[ I will not again put a curse on the earth because of man[ for the thoughts of man{s heart are evil from his earliest days; never again will I send destruction on all living things as I have done]
Gen 8:22 While the earth goes on[ seed time and the getting in of the grain[ cold and heat[ summer and winter[ day and night[ will not come to an end]
Gen 9:1 And God gave his blessing to Noah and his sons[ and said[ Be fertile[ and have increase[ and make the earth full]
Gen 9:2 And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land[ and all the fishes of the sea[ are given into your hands]
Gen 9:3 Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things]
Gen 9:4 But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food]
Gen 9:5 And for your blood[ which is your life[ will I take payment; from every beast I will take it[ and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man]
Gen 9:6 Whoever takes a man{s life[ by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image]
Gen 9:7 And now[ be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number]
Gen 9:8 And God said to Noah and to his sons[
Gen 9:9 Truly[ I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you[
Gen 9:10 And with every living thing with you[ all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you]
Gen 9:11 And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction]
Gen 9:12 And God said[ This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you[ for all future generations:
Gen 9:13 I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth]
Gen 9:14 And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth[ the bow will be seen in the cloud[
Gen 9:15 And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh]
Gen 9:16 And the bow will be in the cloud[ and looking on it[ I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth]
Gen 9:17 And God said to Noah[ This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth]
Gen 9:18 And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem[ Ham[ and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan]
Gen 9:19 These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled]
Gen 9:20 In those days Noah became a farmer[ and he made a vine-garden]
Gen 9:21 And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent]
Gen 9:22 And Ham[ the father of Canaan[ saw his father unclothed[ and gave news of it to his two brothers outside]
Gen 9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a robe[ and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away[ and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed]
Gen 9:24 And[ awaking from his wine[ Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him[ and he said[
Gen 9:25 Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers]
Gen 9:26 And he said[ Praise to the Lord[ the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant]
Gen 9:27 May God make Japheth great[ and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem[ and let Canaan be his servant]
Gen 9:28 And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;
Gen 9:29 all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end]
Gen 10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah[ Shem[ Ham[ and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters
Gen 10:2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras]
Gen 10:3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah]
Gen 10:4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish[ the Kittim and the Dodanim]
Gen 10:5 From these came the nations of the sea-lands[ with their different families and languages]
Gen 10:6 And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan]
Gen 10:7 And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan]
Gen 10:8 And Cush was the father of Nimrod[ who was the first of the great men of the earth]
Gen 10:9 He was a very great bowman[ so that there is a saying[ Like Nimrod[ a very great bowman]
Gen 10:10 And at the first[ his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh[ in the land of Shinar]
Gen 10:11 From that land he went out into Assyria[ building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah[
Gen 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah[ which is a very great town]
Gen 10:13 And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;
Gen 10:14 And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim[ from whom came the Philistines]
Gen 10:15 And Canaan was the father of Zidon[ who was his oldest son[ and Heth[
Gen 10:16 And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite[
Gen 10:17 And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite[
Gen 10:18 And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;
Gen 10:19 Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza[ in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha[ in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim]
Gen 10:20 All these[ with their different families[ languages[ lands[ and nations[ are the offspring of Ham]
Gen 10:21 And Shem[ the older brother of Japheth[ the father of the children of Eber[ had other sons in addition]
Gen 10:22 These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram]
Gen 10:23 And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash]
Gen 10:24 And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber]
Gen 10:25 And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg[ because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother{s name was Joktan]
Gen 10:26 And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
Gen 10:27 And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
Gen 10:28 And Obal and Abimael and Sheba
Gen 10:29 And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan]
Gen 10:30 And their country was from Mesha[ in the direction of Sephar[ the mountain of the east]
Gen 10:31 These[ with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations[ are the offspring of Shem]
Gen 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah[ in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters]
Gen 11:1 And all the earth had one language and one tongue]
Gen 11:2 And it came about that in their wandering from the east[ they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of Shinar[ and there they made their living-place]
Gen 11:3 And they said one to another[ Come[ let us make bricks[ burning them well] And they had bricks for stone[ putting them together with sticky earth]
Gen 11:4 And they said[ Come[ let us make a town[ and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves[ so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth]
Gen 11:5 And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building]
Gen 11:6 And the Lord said[ See[ they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs]
Gen 11:7 Come[ let us go down and take away the sense of their language[ so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another]
Gen 11:8 So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town]
Gen 11:9 So it was named Babel[ because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth]
Gen 11:10 These are the generations of Shem] Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad[ two years after the great flow of waters;
Gen 11:11 And after the birth of Arpachshad[ Shem went on living for five hundred years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:12 And Arpachshad was thirty-five years old when he became the father of Shelah:
Gen 11:13 And after the birth of Shelah[ Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:14 And Shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber:
Gen 11:15 And after the birth of Eber[ Shelah went on living for four hundred and three years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:16 And Eber was thirty-four years old when he became the father of Peleg:
Gen 11:17 And after the birth of Peleg[ Eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:18 And Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu:
Gen 11:19 And after the birth of Reu[ Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:20 And Reu was thirty-two years old when he became the father of Serug:
Gen 11:21 And after the birth of Serug[ Reu went on living for two hundred and seven years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:22 And Serug was thirty years old when he became the father of Nahor:
Gen 11:23 And after the birth of Nahor[ Serug went on living for two hundred years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:24 And Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he became the father of Terah:
Gen 11:25 And after the birth of Terah[ Nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years[ and had sons and daughters:
Gen 11:26 And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram[ Nahor[ and Haran]
Gen 11:27 These are the generations of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram[ Nahor[ and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot]
Gen 11:28 And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth[ Ur of the Chaldees]
Gen 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram{s wife was Sarai[ and the name of Nahor{s wife was Milcah[ the daughter of Haran[ the father of Milcah and Iscah]
Gen 11:30 And Sarai had no child]
Gen 11:31 And Terah took Abram[ his son[ and Lot[ the son of Haran[ and Sarai[ his daughter-in-law[ the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees[ to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran[ and were there for some time]
Gen 11:32 And all the years of Terah{s life were two hundred and five: and Terah came to his end in Haran]
Gen 12:1 Now the Lord said to Abram[ Go out from your country and from your family and from your father{s house[ into the land to which I will be your guide:
Gen 12:2 And I will make of you a great nation[ blessing you and making your name great; and you will be a blessing:
Gen 12:3 To them who are good to you will I give blessing[ and on him who does you wrong will I put my curse: and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth]
Gen 12:4 So Abram went as the Lord had said to him[ and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went away from Haran]
Gen 12:5 And Abram took Sarai[ his wife[ and Lot[ his brother{s son[ and all their goods and the servants which they had got in Haran[ and they went out to go to the land of Canaan]
Gen 12:6 And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem[ to the holy tree of Moreh] At that time[ the Canaanites were still living in the land]
Gen 12:7 And the Lord came to Abram[ and said[ I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him]
Gen 12:8 And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el[ he put up his tent[ having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord]
Gen 12:9 And he went on[ journeying still to the South]
Gen 12:10 And because there was little food to be had in that land[ he went down into Egypt]
Gen 12:11 Now when he came near to Egypt[ he said to Sarai[ his wife[ Truly[ you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;
Gen 12:12 And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you[ they will say[ This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you]
Gen 12:13 Say[ then[ that you are my sister[ and so it will be well with me because of you[ and my life will be kept safe on your account]
Gen 12:14 And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt[ the men of Egypt[ looking on the woman[ saw that she was fair]
Gen 12:15 And Pharaoh{s great men[ having seen her[ said words in praise of her to Pharaoh[ and she was taken into Pharaoh{s house]
Gen 12:16 And because of her[ he was good to Abram[ and he had sheep and oxen and asses[ and men-servants and women-servants[ and camels]
Gen 12:17 And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh{s house because of Sarai[ Abram{s wife]
Gen 12:18 Then Pharaoh sent for Abram[ and said[ What have you done to me& why did you not say that she was your wife&
Gen 12:19 Why did you say that she was your sister& so that I took her for my wife: now[ take your wife and go on your way]
Gen 12:20 And Pharaoh gave orders to his men[ and they sent him on his way[ with his wife and all he had]
Gen 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had[ and Lot with him[ and they came in to the South]
Gen 13:2 Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold]
Gen 13:3 And travelling on from the South[ he came to Beth-el[ to the place where his tent had been before[ between Beth-el and Ai;
Gen 13:4 To the place where he had made his first altar[ and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord]
Gen 13:5 And Lot[ who went with him[ had flocks and herds and tents;
Gen 13:6 So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together]
Gen 13:7 And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram{s cattle and the keepers of Lot{s cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land]
Gen 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot[ Let there be no argument between me and you[ and between my herdmen and your herdmen[ for we are brothers]
Gen 13:9 Is not all the land before you& then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left[ I will go to the right; or if you take the right[ I will go to the left]
Gen 13:10 And Lot[ lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan[ saw that it was well watered everywhere[ before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord[ like the land of Egypt[ on the way to Zoar]
Gen 13:11 So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan[ and went to the east[ and they were parted from one another]
Gen 13:12 Abram went on living in the land of Canaan[ and Lot went to the lowland towns[ moving his tent as far as Sodom]
Gen 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were evil[ and great sinners before the Lord]
Gen 13:14 And the Lord had said to Abram[ after Lot was parted from him[ From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south[ to the east and to the west:
Gen 13:15 For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever]
Gen 13:16 And I will make your children like the dust of the earth[ so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered[ then will your children be numbered]
Gen 13:17 Come[ go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you]
Gen 13:18 And Abram[ moving his tent[ came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre[ which is in Hebron[ and made an altar there to the Lord]
Gen 14:1 Now in the days of Amraphel[ king of Shinar[ Arioch[ king of Ellasar[ Chedorlaomer[ king of Elam[ and Tidal[ king of Goiim[
Gen 14:2 They made war with Bera[ king of Sodom[ and with Birsha[ king of Gomorrah[ Shinab[ king of Admah[ and Shemeber[ king of Zeboiim[ and the king of Bela (which is Zoar)]
Gen 14:3 All these came together in the valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea)]
Gen 14:4 For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer[ but in the thirteenth year they put off his control]
Gen 14:5 And in the fourteenth year[ Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side[ overcame the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim[ and the Zuzim in Ham[ and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim[
Gen 14:6 And the Horites in their mountain Seir[ driving them as far as El-paran[ which is near the waste land]
Gen 14:7 Then they came back to En-mishpat (which is Kadesh)[ making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar]
Gen 14:8 And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar)[ went out[ and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim[
Gen 14:9 Against Chedorlaomer[ king of Elam[ and Tidal[ king of Goiim[ and Amraphel[ king of Shinar[ and Arioch[ king of Ellasar: four kings against the five]
Gen 14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there[ but the rest got away to the mountain]
Gen 14:11 And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way]
Gen 14:12 And in addition they took Lot[ Abram{s brother{s son[ who was living in Sodom[ and all his goods]
Gen 14:13 And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew[ who was living by the holy tree of Mamre[ the Amorite[ the brother of Eshcol and Aner[ who were friends of Abram]
Gen 14:14 And Abram[ hearing that his brother{s son had been made a prisoner[ took a band of his trained men[ three hundred and eighteen of them[ sons of his house[ and went after them as far as Dan]
Gen 14:15 And separating his forces by night[ he overcame them[ putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah[ which is on the north side of Damascus]
Gen 14:16 And he got back all the goods[ and Lot[ his brother{s son[ with his goods and the women and the people]
Gen 14:17 And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings[ he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh[ that is[ the King{s Valley]
Gen 14:18 And Melchizedek[ king of Salem[ the priest of the Most High God[ took bread and wine[
Gen 14:19 And blessing him[ said[ May the blessing of the Most High God[ maker of heaven and earth[ be on Abram:
Gen 14:20 And let the Most High God be praised[ who has given into your hands those who were against you] Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken]
Gen 14:21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram[ Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself]
Gen 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom[ I have taken an oath to the Lord[ the Most High God[ maker of heaven and earth[
Gen 14:23 That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours; so that you may not say[ I have given wealth to Abram:
Gen 14:24 Give me nothing but the food which the fighting-men who went with me have had; but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods]
Gen 15:1 After these things[ the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision[ saying[ Have no fear[ Abram: I will keep you safe[ and great will be your reward]
Gen 15:2 And Abram said[ What will you give me& for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me]
Gen 15:3 And Abram said[ You have given me no child[ and a servant in my house will get the heritage]
Gen 15:4 Then said the Lord[ This man will not get the heritage[ but a son of your body will have your property after you]
Gen 15:5 And he took him out into the open air[ and said to him[ Let your eyes be lifted to heaven[ and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be]
Gen 15:6 And he had faith in the Lord[ and it was put to his account as righteousness]
Gen 15:7 And he said to him[ I am the Lord[ who took you from Ur of the Chaldees[ to give you this land for your heritage]
Gen 15:8 And he said[ O Lord God[ how may I be certain that it will be mine&
Gen 15:9 And he said[ Take a young cow of three years old[ and a she-goat of three years old[ and a sheep of three years old[ and a dove and a young pigeon]
Gen 15:10 All these he took[ cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other[ but not cutting the birds in two]
Gen 15:11 And evil birds came down on the bodies[ but Abram sent them away]
Gen 15:12 Now when the sun was going down[ a deep sleep came on Abram[ and a dark cloud of fear]
Gen 15:13 And he said to Abram[ Truly[ your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs[ as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years;
Gen 15:14 But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are[ and they will come out from among them with great wealth]
Gen 15:15 As for you[ you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place]
Gen 15:16 And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full]
Gen 15:17 Then when the sun went down and it was dark[ he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies]
Gen 15:18 In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram[ and said[ To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river[ the river Euphrates:
Gen 15:19 The Kenite[ the Kenizzite[ and the Kadmonite[
Gen 15:20 And the Hittite[ and the Perizzite[ and the Rephaim[
Gen 15:21 And the Amorite[ and the Canaanite[ and the Girgashite[ and the Jebusite]
Gen 16:1 Now Sarai[ Abram{s wife[ had given him no children; and she had a servant[ a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar]
Gen 16:2 And Sarai said to Abram[ See[ the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant[ for I may get a family through her] And Abram did as Sarai said]
Gen 16:3 So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan[ Sarai took Hagar[ her Egyptian servant[ and gave her to Abram for his wife]
Gen 16:4 And he went in to Hagar and she became with child[ and when she saw that she was with child[ she no longer had any respect for her master{s wife]
Gen 16:5 And Sarai said to Abram[ May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child[ she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me]
Gen 16:6 And Abram said[ The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you] And Sarai was cruel to her[ so that she went running away from her]
Gen 16:7 And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land[ by the fountain on the way to Shur]
Gen 16:8 And he said[ Hagar[ Sarai{s servant[ where have you come from and where are you going& And she said[ I am running away from Sarai[ my master{s wife]
Gen 16:9 And the angel said to her[ Go back[ and put yourself under her authority]
Gen 16:10 And the angel of the Lord said[ Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered]
Gen 16:11 And the angel of the Lord said[ See[ you are with child and will give birth to a son[ to whom you will give the name Ishmael[ because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow]
Gen 16:12 And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man{s hand against him[ and he will keep his place against all his brothers]
Gen 16:13 And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name[ You are a God who is seen; for she said[ Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living&
Gen 16:14 So that fountain was named[ Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered]
Gen 16:15 And Hagar gave birth to a child[ the son of Abram[ to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael]
Gen 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael]
Gen 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old[ the Lord came to him[ and said[ I am God[ Ruler of all; go in my ways and be upright in all things[
Gen 17:2 And I will make an agreement between you and me[ and your offspring will be greatly increased]
Gen 17:3 And Abram went down on his face on the earth[ and the Lord God went on talking with him[ and said[
Gen 17:4 As for me[ my agreement is made with you[ and you will be the father of nations without end]
Gen 17:5 No longer will your name be Abram[ but Abraham[ for I have made you the father of a number of nations]
Gen 17:6 I will make you very fertile[ so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring]
Gen 17:7 And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations[ an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you]
Gen 17:8 And to you and to your seed after you[ I will give the land in which you are living[ all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage; and I will be their God]
Gen 17:9 And God said to Abraham[ On your side[ you are to keep the agreement[ you and your seed after you through all generations]
Gen 17:10 And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me[ you and your seed after you: every male among you is to undergo circumcision]
Gen 17:11 In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it[ as a mark of the agreement between me and you]
Gen 17:12 Every male among you[ from one generation to another[ is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old[ with every servant whose birth takes place in your house[ or for whom you gave money to someone of another country[ and not of your seed]
Gen 17:13 He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price[ all are to undergo circumcision; so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh[ an agreement for all time]
Gen 17:14 And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people: my agreement has been broken by him]
Gen 17:15 And God said[ As for Sarai[ your wife[ from now her name will be not Sarai[ but Sarah]
Gen 17:16 And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her: truly my blessing will be on her[ and she will be the mother of nations: kings of peoples will be her offspring]
Gen 17:17 Then Abraham went down on his face[ and laughing[ said in his heart[ May a man a hundred years old have a child& will Sarah[ at ninety years old[ give birth&
Gen 17:18 And Abraham said to God[ If only Ishmael{s life might be your care!
Gen 17:19 And God said[ Not so; but Sarah[ your wife[ will have a son[ and you will give him the name Isaac[ and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him]
Gen 17:20 As for Ishmael[ I have given ear to your prayer: truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase; he will be the father of twelve chiefs[ and I will make him a great nation]
Gen 17:21 But my agreement will be with Isaac[ to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time]
Gen 17:22 And having said these words[ God went up from Abraham]
Gen 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael[ his son[ and all whose birth had taken place in his house[ and all his servants whom he had made his for a price[ every male of his house[ and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God had said to him]
Gen 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he underwent circumcision]
Gen 17:25 And Ishmael[ his son[ was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision]
Gen 17:26 Abraham and Ishmael[ his son[ underwent circumcision on that very day]
Gen 17:27 And all the men of his house[ those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands[ underwent circumcision with him]
Gen 18:1 Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre[ when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day;
Gen 18:2 And lifting up his eyes[ he saw three men before him; and seeing them[ he went quickly to them from the door of the tent[ and went down on his face to the earth;
Gen 18:3 And said[ My Lord[ if now I have grace in your eyes[ do not go away from your servant:
Gen 18:4 Let me get water for washing your feet[ and take your rest under the tree:
Gen 18:5 And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength[ and after that you may go on your way: for this is why you have come to your servant] And they said[ Let it be so]
Gen 18:6 Then Abraham went quickly into the tent[ and said to Sarah[ Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes]
Gen 18:7 And running to the herd[ he took a young ox[ soft and fat[ and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;
Gen 18:8 And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them[ waiting by them under the tree while they took food]
Gen 18:9 And they said to him[ Where is Sarah your wife& And he said[ She is in the tent]
Gen 18:10 And he said[ I will certainly come back to you in the spring[ and Sarah your wife will have a son] And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door]
Gen 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were very old[ and Sarah was past the time for giving birth]
