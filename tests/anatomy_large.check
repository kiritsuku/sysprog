Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On

the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book
4
<error>
Part
III
-
-
still
in
ms
<error>
-
-
we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>
those
shown

Westcott

we

notice
one

<error>
The

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right

angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

[

He
the
discloses
some
of
the
great
wonders
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

]
Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII
here
]
In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April

th
<error>

it

Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>

<error>

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
summed
up
in

<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

here
]
We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-
3
<error>
is
perfect
in
form
;
all
its
sides
are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2
-
3
-
6
and
7
-
8
-

are
perfectly
equilateral
<error>
That

<error>
7
-
9
-
8
<error>
and
8
-
9
-
10
are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one
-
third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4
-
6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
Further
study
on
the
part
of
the
Student
will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery

Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion

Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>

<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[

The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of

<error>
engrave
his
name

<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words

<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician

Occultists

controls
the
elemental

<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or

Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and

The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the

Nine
Sephiroth

in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH

The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A

of
Unconquered

within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of

the

Aleph

are
the
natures

<error>
Writing

<error>
Writing
flows
like

these
are
all

the
Perfect

substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following
figure

completed
results
of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and

;

(

<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>
M
<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double
<error>
B
<error>
G
<error>

<error>

<error>

<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>

<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will

shown
in
the

Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr

Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc

Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London

In
1887
his
work

of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth

<error>
<error>
Dr

Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIII
here
]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three

dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author

There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter

it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes

<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+
2
+

<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show

913
is

In
the
Beginning
<error>

the
First
Word
of
Genesis
<error>
The
80
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(

)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

and

the
Grace

So

be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in

Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of

Grace
of

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the

verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three

Water
from

<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty

two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and
void

-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a

<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the
earth
<error>
(
Job
xxxvii
<error>

)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

Matter

potentially
a

our

they
become

The

on

all

metamorphoses
of

<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to

<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without
any

it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron

given
in

<error>
Madame

<error>
This

the

when

<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame

has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>

evidently
no

but
the

was
always
taken

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness

<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside

the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of

into

are
constant
forces

The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-

Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book

<error>
Part

still
in

we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance

we
shall
notice
one
very
striking
thing
<error>
The
all
vary
greatly
in

<error>

and

and
squatty
<error>
777
alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus
<error>
[

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle
<error>
[

He

of
the

of
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII
here
]
In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in

Q

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three

Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of

;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>

Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>

and
Sattva

or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>

The

believe
in
Three

in
Three
that
bear

<error>
Many
of
these

Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth

representing
the
Materialized

Manifested
aspect

together
make
Seven

another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of

We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic

<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[

But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[

Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail

<error>
<error>
In

Ten

are

and
twenty

two
the

these
are
the

Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are

<error>
seven
are

are

The

these
are

in
the

Ten
are
the

Learn
this

<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator

on
his
throne

(
Dr
<error>

translation

It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[

Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-

<error>
is
perfect
in

;
all
its

are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2

<error>
and

are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one

third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4

6
-
7
and
5
-
6

8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6

7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth

Further
study
on

of
the

will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber
<error>

note
<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>

following

completed

of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be

to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and
Signs
;
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
hath
taken
His

in
the
East
at
the
Equinox
of
the
Gods
<error>
<error>
(
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit

made

and

PRIMITIVE

HE
ALSO

AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the

and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a

<error>
or
the

<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>

)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV

Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with

<error>
He
looked

<error>
He
looked

So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

<error>
Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and

to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit

Invisible
Paths
of

Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition

Commenting
upon
Verses

-

-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the

<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered

-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our

Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One

by
the
Grace
of

and
by
the
Favor
of

AUMN
This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three
-
-
Water
from
Air
<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and
void
-
-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a
building
<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the
earth
<error>
(
Job
xxxvii
<error>
6
)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos
or
Matter
is
potentially
a
prism
which
refracts
the
great
Light

up
the

As
matter
or
substance
becomes
organized
and
develops
mind
<error>
its
power
as
a
prism
grows
<error>
As
we
clarify
our
minds
they
become
as
living
<error>
organic
prisms
which
act
with
increasing
precision
and
detail
<error>
The
more
definite
and
authentic
our
ideas
<error>
the
more
accurate
and
mathematical
<error>
the
more
will
they
focus
Light

He

<error>
<error>
-
-
on
the
whole
all
plants
are
only
metamorphoses
of
the
Syngenesis
<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in
the
Mathesis
;
without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams
<error>
as
the

startling
confirmation
of
what
followed
upon

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the

<error>
Madame

continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the
same
idea
as
the

ten
in
all
<error>
yet
when
separated
from
the
upper

<error>

<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame
Blavatsky
has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>
but
evidently
no
comprehension
of
the
solid

I
wish

said

but
the

was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of

this

seems
to

that

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In

<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>

<error>
The

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure

and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri

divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in

each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>

<error>
<error>
The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
summed
up
in
the

of
Malkuth

the
Kingdom
<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

the
Alchemist
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII

<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain

first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree

it
is
written

<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation

Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber
<error>
s
note
<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following
figure
is
the
completed
results
of
those
investigations
<error>
[
insert
Figure
XIX

Frater
Achad

s
Tree
of
Life
<error>
]
It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
)
produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law

But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[

]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>
M
<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double
<error>
B
<error>
G
<error>
D
<error>
K
<error>

<error>

<error>

<error>
I
<error>

<error>

O

<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>
Height
and

<error>
East
and

<error>
North
and
South
<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(

glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever

increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing

flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra

giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence
<error>

Chapter
IX
Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition
of
100
copies
by
Robert
H
<error>
Fryar
of
Bath
<error>
England
<error>
Commenting
upon
Verses
9
-
10
-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

XXXIII

]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess

that
are
about

neck
<error>
Amen

Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic

<error>
says

<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the

To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+

<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show

The

<error>
the
20
th
of
the

<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(

)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

and

the
Grace

So
mote
it
be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One

by
the
Grace
of

by
the

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber

and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

<error>
a
new
literal
translation
of
the
Sepher

<error>
by
Mr

Knut
Stenring
<error>
has
appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>

He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty

two

from

mire
and

He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a

<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became

even
as
it

He
saith
to
the

<error>
Be
thou

<error>
(
Job

)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

Matter

on

all

metamorphoses
of

Here
is
united
<error>
what
in

is
only
blossoming

<error>
The
importance
of
the

five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the
Mayas

<error>
Madame

continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the

idea
as
the

Tree
<error>
ten
in
all

yet
when
separated
from
the
upper

<error>

the

<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame
Blavatsky
has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>

evidently
no

I
wish

said

but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter
and
this
obscure

seems
to
indicate
that
if

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On

the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book
4
<error>
Part
III
-
-
still
in
ms
<error>
-
-
we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>
those
shown
in
Westcott

the
Study
of

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right

angled

The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[

Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

He
the
discloses
some
of
the
great
wonders
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

]
Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII

]
In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April

Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q

<error>

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree

are
summed
up
in

<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

figure
XIV
here
]
We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-
3
<error>
is
perfect
in
form
;
all
its
sides
are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2
-
3
-
6
and
7
-
8
-
10
are
perfectly
equilateral
<error>
That

-
8
<error>
7
-
9
-
8
<error>
and
8
-
9
-
10
are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one
-
third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4
-
6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
Further
study
on
the
part
of
the
Student
will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an

Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion

Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>

<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>

<error>

<error>

XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[

The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of

<error>
engrave
his
name

<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words

and
<error>
thirty

<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the

controls
the

It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or

Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of

The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the

Sephiroth

in
the
Great

AHIHVH

Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A

Yod
is
the

He
of

are
the
natures

<error>
Writing

<error>
Writing
flows

these
are
all

the
Perfect

form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following

completed
results
of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and

;

(

<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>
M
<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double
<error>
B
<error>
G
<error>

<error>

<error>

<error>

<error>

O

Tz
<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>

and

North
and

<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See
plate
<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published

11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIII
here
]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These

If

<error>
good
is

<error>
if

manner
<error>
evil
is

<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+
2
+

<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show
913
Sephiroth
<error>
913
is
BRAShITh
<error>
Berashith

<error>
In
the
Beginning
<error>
-
-
the
First
Word
of
Genesis
<error>
The
80
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(
9
)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

)
and

by
the
Grace
of
God

So

be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become

In

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the

verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three

Water

<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty

two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and

-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a

<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the

<error>
(
Job

<error>

)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

Matter

potentially
a

our

they
become

The

on

all

metamorphoses
of

<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to

<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without
any

it
lies
hidden
under
the

given

<error>
Madame

This

the

<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame

has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>

evidently
no

the

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to

Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside

the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of

into

are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-

Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book

<error>
Part

still
in

<error>

we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>

we
shall
notice
one
very
striking
thing
<error>
The
all
vary
greatly
in
their

<error>

and

<error>
others

and
squatty
<error>
777
alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus
<error>
[

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle
<error>
[

He

of

Piscis
and

out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII

In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in

The
Hindus
venerate

AUM

the
most

Three
Aspects
as
Brahma

Vishnu

the

Preserver
<error>

Many
of

are

up
in
a
Fourth

representing
the
Materialized

aspect

together
make

another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of

We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic

<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[

But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[

Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail

The

<error>
<error>
In

Ten

are

and
twenty

two
the

these
are
the

<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are

<error>
seven
are

are

The

these
are

in
the

Ten
are
the

Learn
this

<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator

on
his
throne

(
Dr
<error>

translation

It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[

Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7

10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-

<error>
is
perfect
in

;
all
its

are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2

<error>
and

are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one

third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4

6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth

Further
study
on

of
the

will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber
<error>

note
<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following

completed
results
of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be

to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and
Signs
;
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
hath
taken
His

in
the
East
at
the
Equinox
of
the
Gods
<error>
<error>
(
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in

<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>

Second
<error>

the

FROM
HIS

and
from
the

even
as

<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his

and
his
ministers
a

fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm

)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV

<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH

<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with

Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West

with

He
looked

<error>
He
looked

So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

<error>
Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition
of
100
copies

Commenting
upon
Verses
9
-
10
-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the

<error>
Through

Through
the

ultimate

of
the

<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen

Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>

Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One

by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune

and
by
the
Favor
of

AUMN
This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three
-
-
Water
from
Air
<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and
void
-
-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a
building
<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the
earth
<error>
(
Job
xxxvii
<error>
6
)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos
or
Matter
is
potentially
a
prism
which
refracts
the
great
Light

Source
<error>
splitting
up
the
Supernal
Light
into
stars
<error>
or

Consciousness

Ideas
<error>
As
matter
or
substance
becomes
organized
and
develops
mind
<error>
its
power
as
a
prism
grows
<error>
As
we
clarify
our
minds
they
become
as
living
<error>
organic
prisms
which
act
with
increasing
precision
and
detail
<error>
The
more
definite
and
authentic
our
ideas
<error>
the
more
accurate
and
mathematical
<error>
the
more
will
they
focus
Light
from
the
Supreme
<error>
till
<error>
sleeping
stars
<error>
slip
on
their
livery
of

<error>
The
more
exact
the
form
<error>

closer

correspondence
between
the

since

<error>

<error>
has
been
brought
to
my
attention
<error>
He
writes

<error>
<error>
-
-
on
the
whole
all
plants
are
only
metamorphoses
of
the
Syngenesis
<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in
the
Mathesis
;
without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams
<error>
as
the
crystallized
sphere
<error>

This
startling
confirmation
of
what
followed
upon
my
own
researches

mentioning
the

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the
Mayas
and
Quiches
<error>
Madame
Blavatsky
continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the
same
idea
as
the
Sphirothal
Tree
<error>
ten
in
all
<error>
yet
when
separated
from
the
upper
triad
<error>

seven

are

seeds
<error>
making
up

<error>
or
the
Dodecahedron
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame
Blavatsky
has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>
but
evidently
no
comprehension
of
the
solid
prismatic
sections

for
the

The

I
wish
she
had
said
which
Kabalists
;
but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter
and
this
obscure

seems
to
indicate
that
if
one

he
would
discover
its

to

that

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In

<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>

Let

<error>
The

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure

and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri

divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure

and
the
equilateral

again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;

divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>

<error>
<error>
The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
summed
up
in
the

of
Malkuth

the
Kingdom
<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

Alchemist
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(

might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge

from
the

it

Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co

operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme

Creation

Therefor
we
find
an

no

between
Binah
and
Chesed

a

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here

The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber
<error>
s
note
<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following
figure
is
the
completed
results
of
those
investigations
<error>
[
insert
Figure

Frater
Achad

s
Tree
of
Life
<error>
]
It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
)
produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>

the
Book

But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[

]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers

<error>
Sh

seven
are
double

;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire

<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(

A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Chapter
IX
Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition
of
100
copies
by
Robert
H
<error>
Fryar
of
Bath

England
<error>
Commenting
upon
Verses
9
-
10
-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess

that
are
about

<error>
Amen

Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>

Platonist

the

<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal

equilateral
pentagons

consists
of
twenty
solid

of
which

is

<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+
2
+

<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show

is

The

of

<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(

)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

and

the
Grace
of

So
mote
it
be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune

and
by
the

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber

and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

Since

<error>
a
new
literal
translation
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
by
Mr
<error>
Knut
Stenring
<error>
has
appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>

He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty

two

He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a

<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth

even
as
it

He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou

<error>
(
Job

)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

Matter

potentially
a

they

The

on

all

metamorphoses
of

Here
is
united
<error>
what
in

is
only
blossoming

<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the

<error>
Madame

continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the

idea
as
the

<error>
ten
in
all

yet
when
separated
from
the
upper

the

This
indicates
that
Madame

has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah

evidently
no

said

but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter

this

to

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On

the

<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book
4
<error>
Part
III
-
-
still
in
ms
<error>
-
-
we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>
those
shown
in
Westcott
<error>
s
<error>
Introduction
to
the
Study
of
the
Kabalah

one

The

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right

angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

He
the
discloses
some
of
the
great
wonders
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

]
Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII

]
In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on

whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q

<error>

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree

are
summed
up
in

<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

here
]
We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-
3
<error>
is
perfect
in
form
;
all
its
sides
are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2
-
3
-
6
and
7
-

are
perfectly
equilateral

<error>
7
-
9
-

<error>
and
8
-
9
-
10
are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one
-
third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4
-
6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
Further
study
on
the
part
of
the
Student
will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>

presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these

to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion

<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>

<error>

)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[

The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of

<error>
engrave
his
name

<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words

<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth

which
is
attributed
to

or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the

It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or

<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of

The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the

Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod

He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH

represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A

Yod
is
the

He
of

<error>

these
are

for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following

completed
results
of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and

<error>
(

<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>
M
<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double
<error>
B
<error>
G
<error>
D
<error>

<error>
I
<error>
L
<error>

O
<error>
Tz
<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>
Height
and

and

North
and
South
<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence
<error>

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published

11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIII
here
]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in

<error>
These

the

<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

31
)
extended
(
1
+
2
+
3
<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show
913
Sephiroth
<error>
913
is
BRAShITh
<error>
Berashith

<error>
In
the
Beginning
<error>
-
-
the
First
Word
of
Genesis
<error>
The
80
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(
9
)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

)
and

by
the
Grace
of
God

So
mote
it
be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
of
the
Ever
-

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the

verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three

Water
from

<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty

two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and

-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a

<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the

<error>
(
Job

)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

Matter

potentially
a

our

they
become

The

on

all

metamorphoses
of

<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in

is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to

<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without

it
lies
hidden
under

given

<error>
Madame

This

<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame

has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>

evidently
no

the

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit

as
their

<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book

<error>
Part

still
in

<error>

we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>

we
shall
notice
one
very
striking
thing
<error>
The
all
vary
greatly
in
their

<error>

and

<error>
others

and
squatty
<error>
777
alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus
<error>
[

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle
<error>
[

He

of
the

the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII

In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown

Hindus

Aspects
as
Brahma

<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a

inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three

Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The

together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[

But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[

and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[

Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself

we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail

<error>
<error>
In

Ten

and
twenty

the

these
are
the

Of
these

<error>
three
are

<error>
seven
are

The

these
are

in
the

Ten
are
the

Learn
this

<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator

on
his
throne

<error>
(
Dr
<error>

translation

It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[

Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-
3
<error>
is
perfect
in

;
all
its

are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2

and

are

<error>
and

are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one

third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4
-
6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth

Further
study
on

part
of
the

will
disclose
many
other
proportions

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber

<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>

following

completed

of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth

the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to

<error>
the
Father
of
the

<error>
will
be

to
connect

Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and
Signs
;
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
hath
taken
His

in
the
East
at
the
Equinox
of
the
Gods
<error>
<error>
(
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

figure

here
]
Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit

PRIMITIVE

HE
ALSO

AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the

and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a

<error>
or
the

<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>

)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with

Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with

He
looked

<error>
He
looked

So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

<error>
Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;

to
Scorpio
;
and

to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition
of

copies

Commenting
upon
Verses
9
-
10
-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the

gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the

<error>
stones
of
precious

<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original

Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of

the
Grace
of

the
Favor

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber

and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

has
appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three
-
-
Water
from
Air
<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and
void
-
-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a
building
<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the
earth
<error>
(
Job
xxxvii
<error>
6
)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos
or
Matter
is
potentially
a
prism
which
refracts
the
great
Light
-
Source
<error>
splitting
up
the
Supernal
Light
into
stars
<error>
or
the
Supreme
Consciousness
into
Ideas
<error>
As
matter
or
substance
becomes
organized
and
develops
mind
<error>
its
power
as
a
prism
grows
<error>
As
we
clarify
our
minds
they
become
as
living
<error>
organic
prisms
which
act
with
increasing
precision
and
detail
<error>
The
more
definite
and
authentic
our
ideas
<error>
the
more
accurate
and
mathematical
<error>
the
more
will
they
focus
Light
from
the
Supreme
<error>
till
<error>
sleeping
stars
<error>
slip
on
their
livery
of
light
<error>
The
more
exact
the
form
<error>
the
closer
the
correspondence
between
the
Son

)
and

since
writing

<error>
s
work

<error>
has
been
brought
to
my
attention
<error>
He
writes
<error>
page

<error>
<error>
-
-
on
the
whole
all
plants
are
only
metamorphoses
of
the
Syngenesis
<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in
the
Mathesis
;
without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams
<error>
as
the
crystallized
sphere
<error>

This
startling
confirmation
of
what
followed
upon
my
own
researches

mentioning
the
form
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the
Mayas
and
Quiches
<error>
Madame
Blavatsky
continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the
same
idea
as
the
Sphirothal
Tree
<error>
ten
in
all
<error>
yet
when
separated
from
the
upper
triad
<error>
leaving
seven
<error>

are
the

seeds
<error>
making
up
12
<error>
or
the
Dodecahedron
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame
Blavatsky
has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>
but
evidently
no
comprehension
of
the
solid
prismatic
sections

necessary
for
the
building

The

<error>
I
wish
she
had
said
which
Kabalists
;
but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter
and
this
obscure
reference
seems
to
indicate
that
if
one
understood
matter
<error>
he
would
discover
its
structure
to
be
that
of

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on

The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a

Living

not

Introduction
On
April
the
fourteenth
<error>
nineteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th
-
-
shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In

<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>

<error>

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right
-
angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points
<error>
thus

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V

and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri

sub

divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in

the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April
14
th
<error>
and
it
will
form
the
subject
of
our
further
studies
and
researches
<error>
Chapter
II
Before
discussing
in
detail
the
events
which
led
up
to
this
discovery
<error>
and
the
further
application
of
it
to
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
it
will
be
well
if
we
spend
a
little
time
in
considering
the
Nature
of
the
Trinity
<error>
and
its
fundamental
relation
to
all
Systems
of
Religious
and
Philosophic
thought
<error>
Hermes
the
Thrice
Greatest
<error>
like
Solomon
<error>
is
highly
celebrated
by
antiquity
for
his
wisdom
and
skill
in
the
secret
operations
of
nature
<error>
and
for
his
<error>
reputed
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
quintessential
<error>
perfectibility
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
kingdoms
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
homogeneal
<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree
of

are
summed
up
in

<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott

translation

It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we

the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of

<error>
in

Figure
(

<error>

One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the

hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH

child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah

it

not

it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto

we
are
clearly
told
that
the

thirty

is
to

<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations

their

formed

we
notice

from

Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the

of

But
this

represents
the

Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man

it
is
part
of
the

may

The
learned
but
anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>
published
by
Elkin
Mathews
in
1897
<error>
makes
several
important
statements
in
regard
to
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
Architecture
<error>
etc
<error>
He
writes
<error>
<error>
It
is
known
<error>
both
to
freemasons
and
architects
<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
was
a
symbol
applied
by
the
masons
in
planning
their
temples
<error>
Albert
Durer
<error>
Serlio
<error>
and
other
architectural
writers
depict
the
Vesica
in
their
works
<error>
but
presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these
authors
make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>
p
<error>
109
)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[
Transcriber
<error>
s
note
<error>
The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words
<error>
two
<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician
or
Occultists
who
controls
the
elemental
forces
<error>
Thirty
is
<error>
Lamed
<error>
or
<error>
Ox
-
Goad
<error>
or
sharp
pointed
<error>
engraver
<error>
<error>
It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or
<error>
Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of
Live
and
Will
<error>
The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the
other
Nine
Sephiroth
<error>
coalesced
<error>
in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH
which
embraces
the
whole
Ten
in
One
<error>
The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A
<error>
the
Microcosm
or
Star
of
Unconquered
Will
)
within
them
<error>
Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire
<error>
He
of
Water
<error>
and
the
concealed
Aleph
is
Air
<error>
These
are
the
natures
of
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
by
which
Jah
is
said
to
have
created
the
Universe
<error>
Number
is
Fire
(
the
writing
of
the
Starts
)
<error>
Writing
flows
like
Water
<error>
and
Air
is
the
basis
of
Speech
<error>
But
these
are
all
mysteriously
connected
symbolically
with
the
Perfect
Number
10
<error>
of
which
0
is
the
Naught
of
the
Unmanifest
<error>
and
1
the
First
Positive
Idea
<error>
The
Mouth
from
which
issues
the
Fire
of
the
Spirit
in
the
form
of
Breath
<error>
and
also
the
Water
<error>
is
when
closed
<error>
a
horizontal
line
<error>
When
open
it
is
a
Circle
;
thus
<error>
10
<error>
The
Pen
whereby
Ideas
are
transmitted
in
the
form
of
Writing
<error>
has
been
referred
to
in
the
Scriptures
and
<error>
The
Pen
of
a
Man
<error>
and
this
is
dipped
in
a
vessel
which
represents
both
a
line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following
figure
is
the
completed
results
of
those
investigations
<error>
[
insert
Figure
XIX
here
-
-
Frater
Achad
<error>
s
Tree
of
Life
<error>
]
It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
)
produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals

But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[

]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>
M
<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double
<error>
B
<error>
G
<error>
D
<error>
K
<error>
P
<error>

<error>

;
and

<error>
I
<error>
L
<error>

O

Tz
<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>
Height
and
Depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute

A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>

We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence
<error>

Chapter
IX
Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in
a
limited
edition
of
100
copies
by
Robert
H
<error>
Fryar
of
Bath
<error>
England
<error>
Commenting
upon
Verses
9
-
10
-
11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[

XXXIII

]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author
<error>
There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess

that
are
about

neck
<error>
Amen
!

Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many

formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides

CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD
HVVG
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+
2
+

<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show
913

913
is

the
First

<error>
The

progression
of
the

<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(

)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

and

the
Grace
of

So
mote
it
be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the

Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name

of

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber

and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

a
new
literal
translation

<error>
by
Mr

<error>
has
appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand

He
wrote
and
formed

twenty

He
designed
them
as
a

<error>
He
hewed
them
as

<error>
He
covered
them
as

<error>
He
poured

saith
to

Be
thou

<error>
(
Job

<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos

on

all

is

<error>
what
in

<error>
The
importance
of
the

<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to

<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in

without
any

it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of

<error>
Madame

continues

<error>
This
represents
the

idea
as

ten
in

yet
when
separated

This
indicates
that
Madame

has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the

evidently
no

wish

said

but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter

this

seems
to
indicate
that
if

Preface
Although
the
title
of
this
short
essay
may
seem
<error>
to
some
who
have
not
read
its
contents
<error>
to
be
both
presumptuous
and
unwarrantable
<error>
it
is
hoped
that
these
will
reserve
their
judgment
until
they
have
given
due
attention
and
consideration
to
the
study
of
such
an
important
subject
<error>
We
are
living
in
strange
times
<error>
Civilization
seems
rapidly
to
be
breaking
up
<error>
while
yet
some
inner
urge
is
at
work
towards
a
better
and
more
balanced
construction
in
may
departments
of
life
<error>
One
of
the
results
of
the
Great
War
has
been
to
turn
the
minds
of
many
people
from
some
of
the
narrower
conceptions
of
life
into
wider
channels
<error>
A
spirit
of
enquiry
has
become
apparent
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
previously
been
content
to
accept
statements
in
regard
to
life
<error>
s
deeper
issues
on
mere
belief
or
hearsay
<error>
Many
new
Movements
have
arisen
under
the
guidance
of
people
who
have
obtained
at
least
a
partial
glimpse
of
man
<error>
s
wider
heritage
<error>
and
there
has
been
a
corresponding
falling
away
from
what
may
be
termed
the
orthodox
or
established
order
of
things
in
the
churches
and
elsewhere
<error>
Many
countries
have
been
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
<error>
most
of
which
<error>
however
<error>
being
the
outcome
of
<error>
reform
movements
<error>
of
the
narrowest
sort
<error>
are
quickly
proving
themselves
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
<error>
At
present
<error>
amid
all
these
indications
<error>
there
seems
to
have
been
no
complete
solution
in
sight
<error>
and
<error>
so
it
might
appear
<error>
very
little
comprehension
<error>
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
honestly
doing
their
best
under
the
circumstances
<error>
of
the
underlying
principles
involved
<error>
Those
who
should
really
be
in
a
position
to
help
<error>
are
unable
to
do
so
effectively
for
the
same
reason
<error>
It
may
seem
a
far
cry
from
the
present
world
-
conditions
of
a
social
and
political
nature
to
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
but
help
sometimes
comes
from
quite
unexpected
sources
<error>
The
Jews
<error>
and
the
Jewish
problem
<error>
represent
very
important
aspects
of
the
difficulty
and
its
solution
<error>
A
great
proportion
of
the
wealth
of
the
world
is
today
in
the
hands
of
the
Jews
<error>
yet
as
a
nation
they
have
no
place
<error>
As
the
<error>
chosen
people
<error>
they
were
an
important
nation
<error>
but
the
rejection
of
the
Teacher
in
who
they
expected
to
find
their
Messiah
<error>
is
usually
considered
to
have
been
the
cause
of
their
becoming
wanderers
upon
the
face
of
the
Earth
<error>
Yet
the
word
<error>
Jew
<error>
is
derived
from
IU
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Horus
of
the
earliest
Egyptian
traditions
<error>
whose
influence
is
not
confined
to
the
Christian
Era
but
extends
to
all
Ages
<error>
and
of
Whom
all
truly
typical
God
-
Men
<error>
such
as
Jesus
<error>
have
been
<error>
and
are
<error>
the
representatives
upon
earth
<error>
But
the
Jews
have
neglected
the
study
of
their
own
<error>
Chokmah
Nestorah
<error>
<error>
or
Secret
Wisdom
Tradition
<error>
as
transmitted
in
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
thus
losing
sight
of
their
True
Will
as
a
nation
and
their
essential
Purpose
in
the
Great
Creative
Plan
<error>
It
has
remained
for
the
Gentile
to
rediscover
some
of
the
deeper
mysteries
of
this
Ancient
Wisdom
<error>
and
these
are
found
to
be
the
same
in
essence
as
those
of
Catholicism
<error>
Freemasonry
<error>
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
Hermeticism
<error>
and
so
forth
;
in
fact
there
has
always
been
a
Universal
Tradition
which
when
known
has
led
the
Nations
to
the
height
of
civilization
<error>
and
when
lost
has
heralded
their
decline
and
downfall
<error>
The
present
world
-
crisis
and
breaking
up
of
civilization
is
due
to
the
necessity
of
a
general
<error>
clean
-
up
<error>
preparatory
to
a
wider
and
grander
conception
being
presented
to
humanity
than
has
been
possible
for
many
thousands
of
years
<error>
All
thinking
people
realize
that
things
are
in
a
critical
condition
<error>
and
all
should
be
prepared
to
grasp
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
solution
which
will
be
of
permanent
<error>
rather
than
of
temporary
value
<error>
Things
cannot
be
put
right
without
effort
<error>
and
the
question
arises
<error>
<error>
In
what
direction
is
effort
most
necessary
<error>
<error>
The
solution
lies
with
the
individual
;
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reforming
others
until
we
have
reformed
ourselves
<error>
It
is
equally
useless
to
rely
upon
someone
else
to
do
for
use
what
we
are
quite
capable
of
doing
and
should
do
for
ourselves
<error>
The
soul
of
Man
-
-
which
is
the
plastic
mediator
between
body
and
spirit
-
-
has
become
distorted
;
he
must
learn
to
rectify
its
structure
before
he
can
obtain
a
clear
outlook
and
a
proper
point
of
view
<error>
Man
<error>
s
teachers
have
been
largely
responsible
for
distorting
his
mental
vision
<error>
and
they
must
cease
from
restricting
his
natural
actions
and
impeding
his
natural
growth
<error>
which
would
be
normally
proportioned
if
the
Holy
Spirit
within
were
allowed
to
expand
in
the
proper
manner
<error>
Man
<error>
s
natural
tendency
is
towards
health
of
body
and
soul
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
Most
of
the
present
systems
have
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
from
his
earliest
childhood
<error>
thus
handicapping
him
from
the
start
<error>
The
child
is
<error>
in
one
sense
<error>
the
best
example
of
the
perfect
man
or
woman
<error>
and
if
the
child
were
allowed
to
develop
Intelligence
unhampered
by
false
notions
from
outside
<error>
it
would
grow
to
be
the
true
example
of
the
God
-
Man
or
Man
-
God
in
the
majority
of
cases
<error>
We
have
ruined
our
children
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
come
to
maturity
;
our
well
-
meaning
<error>
though
ignorant
<error>
parents
and
childhood
teachers
have
instilled
into
our
subconscious
minds
most
of
the
<error>
complexes
<error>
which
in
after
life
we
can
only
eradicate
by
bitter
toil
and
bloody
sweat
<error>
Yet
I
thank
God
for
a
good
mother
<error>
whose
simple
faith
<error>
transmitted
to
me
<error>
has
given
me
the
quiet
courage
and
perseverance
to
unravel
some
<error>
at
least
<error>
of
those
ignorantly
transmitted
<error>
knots
<error>
and
kinks
<error>
But
<error>
for
all
that
<error>
humanity
has
complexes
which
need
to
be
unraveled
and
straightened
out
before
much
real
work
can
be
done
<error>
First
<error>
then
<error>
let
me
make
an
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
children
<error>
even
if
in
this
New
Aeon
they
do
not
so
much
need
my
support
since
they
are
showing
an
independence
of
spirit
which
is
simply
astonishing
to
their
parents
and
guardians
who
were
born
and
brought
up
under
the
Old
Dispensation
<error>
I
make
my
appeal
to
these
same
parents
<error>
not
to
foolishly
try
to
break
the
Will
of
the
child
<error>
for
it
is
God
<error>
s
Will
therein
<error>
and
the
only
indication
of
the
right
course
of
action
<error>
Once
this
True
Will
is
distorted
<error>
and
the
lower
personal
will
brought
out
of
alignment
with
it
<error>
the
city
is
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
divided
against
itself
and
cannot
stand
<error>
It
is
the
interior
conflict
between
the
<error>
personal
<error>
and
the
<error>
True
<error>
Will
in
each
of
us
<error>
that
is
the
cause
of
all
suffering
and
all
wrong
action
<error>
There
is
but
one
remedy
<error>
discover
the
True
Will
and
then
DO
IT
<error>
and
our
course
is
one
with
Destiny
and
the
Will
of
the
Universe
in
our
regard
<error>
The
age
of
<error>
mothering
<error>
children
is
past
<error>
The
women
of
today
failing
to
do
so
in
regard
to
their
offspring
<error>
or
having
no
offspring
to
<error>
mother
<error>
are
doing
all
they
can
to
<error>
mother
<error>
the
nation
<error>
particularly
in
America
<error>
Such
<error>
reforms
<error>
as
Prohibition
are
largely
due
to
this
mistaken
zeal
for
the
good
of
others
<error>
What
the
<error>
Mothers
<error>
need
most
is
to
learn
to
mind
their
own
business
and
to
correct
their
own
distorted
vision
<error>
Repression
can
never
take
the
place
of
RIGHT
USE
on
any
plane
<error>
The
Righteous
are
those
who
use
rightly
what
they
have
<error>
for
their
own
good
and
that
of
Humanity
from
which
they
can
never
really
cut
themselves
off
<error>
Man
cannot
live
<error>
or
die
<error>
to
himself
alone
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
Nations
<error>
All
things
come
from
One
Substance
<error>
and
are
actuated
by
One
Spirit
<error>
Rightly
used
<error>
any
aspect
of
that
substance
may
be
taken
into
the
body
and
soul
of
Man
<error>
and
there
transmuted
into
just
the
proper
condition
and
proportions
for
the
building
up
of
his
own
particular
being
<error>
If
<error>
for
instance
<error>
it
were
possible
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
wine
from
all
the
American
people
for
two
or
three
generations
<error>
they
would
go
to
the
most
terrible
extremes
and
act
as
savages
do
whose
systems
have
not
been
used
to
alcohol
<error>
as
soon
as
the
habit
was
revived
<error>
as
it
inevitably
would
be
in
the
long
run
<error>
As
it
is
<error>
insofar
as
their
parents
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
wine
<error>
they
are
comparatively
immune
while
their
normal
appetites
in
this
respect
are
not
over
-
stimulated
by
the
attempt
at
repression
<error>
Many
of
the
most
normal
people
drink
more
under
<error>
prohibition
<error>
than
they
ever
though
of
doing
before
<error>
The
best
men
and
women
are
those
of
such
varied
experience
on
all
planes
that
they
are
immune
from
every
poison
and
every
disease
because
they
have
found
the
proper
proportion
and
balance
of
all
that
is
called
good
and
evil
makes
up
the
Perfect
Man
who
is
like
unto
his
Father
in
Heaven
<error>
in
Whom
all
things
have
their
being
<error>
Man
must
eat
of
the
Tree
of
the
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
before
he
comes
to
the
Tree
of
Life
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
<error>
Only
when
he
eats
too
much
of
one
thing
and
not
enough
of
another
<error>
does
his
body
or
soul
become
distorted
<error>
Every
<error>
Christ
<error>
and
every
Genius
has
been
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
<error>
as
well
as
of
the
<error>
selected
and
exclusive
<error>
<error>
Idealism
and
Materialism
must
unite
and
go
hand
in
hand
if
a
new
Civilization
is
to
be
build
up
<error>
The
Soul
of
Humanity
is
the
connecting
link
<error>
There
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
our
material
bodies
<error>
but
they
would
not
be
of
much
use
without
the
Spirit
and
Will
which
give
them
Life
and
motion
<error>
On
the
other
hand
we
should
not
be
so
cowardly
and
selfish
as
to
desire
to
be
re
-
absorbed
into
Spirit
<error>
as
if
the
whole
Creative
Plan
were
a
waste
of
time
<error>
and
had
better
never
have
been
started
<error>
No
!
Let
us
give
thanks
in
our
souls
for
both
body
and
spirit
<error>
using
both
rightly
and
to
the
full
extent
of
our
power
<error>
But
how
shall
we
learn
the
right
proportions
of
each
<error>
We
must
eat
of
the
Fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
it
will
be
found
to
nourish
us
perfectly
and
cause
all
the
elements
of
our
system
to
come
to
their
proper
proportion
and
fullness
of
stature
<error>
We
must
enter
upon
the
heritage
of
Freedom
that
has
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
Father
<error>
s
Kingdom
upon
Earth
<error>
We
have
sacrificed
the
flower
of
Humanity
<error>
not
alone
in
the
Great
War
but
in
many
<error>
many
ways
<error>
to
our
false
gods
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
True
and
Living
God
<error>
let
us
cease
from
bloody
sacrifice
<error>
and
start
to
build
a
<error>
Living
Temple
<error>
not
made
with
hands
<error>
eternal
in
the
Heavens

Introduction
On

nineteen

three
E
<error>
V
<error>
<error>
having
just
completed
the
ms
<error>
of
my
treatise
on
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
or
The
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
in
which
my
endeavor
was
to
show
that
the
<error>
Restored
Order
<error>
of
the
Paths
of
the
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
was
likely
to
be
the
correct
one
<error>
since
it
indicated
the
Universal
Tradition
as
symbolized
by
the
Keys
of
Hermes
<error>
I
was
rewarded
by
the
opening
up
of
an
amazing
further
possibility
in
regard
to
the
Design
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
itself
<error>
It
was
between
8
<error>
0
and
9
<error>
0
P
<error>
M
<error>
on
the
above
date
<error>
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
began
to
GROW
<error>
and
proved
itself
<error>
to
my
mind
<error>
to
be
the
veritable
anatomy
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Ever
-
coming
<error>
between
the
two
Infinites
<error>
This
fresh
revelation
left
me
strangely
silent
;
it
seemed
almost
too
wonderful
to
be
true
<error>
but
it
has
since
-
-
for
I
am
writing
this
on
April
17
th

shown
even
greater
possibilities
<error>
the
most
extraordinary
of
which
was
only
revealed
to
me
this
afternoon
<error>
after
discussing
the
matter
with
W
<error>
R
<error>
I
do
not
intend
to
write
of
the
discovery
itself
for
the
moment
<error>
but
merely
to
prepare
a
brief
essay
on
the
Qabalah
by
means
of
further
Light
I
have
so
recently
received
<error>
This
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
more
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
which
<error>
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
to
my
readers
<error>
will
require
a
number
of
diagrams
showing
the
different
stages
of
its
development
<error>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
<error>
As
stated
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
Qabalists
postulated
the
AIN
or
NO
-
THING
as
the
Zero
from
which
<error>
in
a
mysterious
manner
<error>
the
Universe
arose
<error>
Next
<error>
they
say
<error>
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
or
Limitless
Space
<error>
became
the
Nature
of
the
AIN
<error>
and
this
conception
was
followed
by
that
of
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
or
Limitless
Light
of
Chaos
<error>
It
was
not
until
this
Limitless
Light
had
concentrated
Itself
to
a
Center
that
the
First
Positive
Idea
arose
<error>
and
this
was
called
Kether
and
attributed
to
the
Number
One
<error>
From
this
One
there
arose
in
succession
the
other
Numerical
Emanations
or
Sephiroth
from
Two
to
Ten
<error>
thus
completing
the
decimal
scale
of
Numbers
<error>
The
Number
10
is
said
to
represent
the
return
of
the
One
to
Zero
<error>
thus
completing
the
Cycle
of
Manifestation
<error>
These
ideas
may
be
found
more
fully
described
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
but
I
now
desire
to
attempt
a
slightly
different
presentation
<error>
which
will
be
developed
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
book
<error>
The
finite
mind
of
man
is
unable
to
grasp
the
Infinite
<error>
except
in
a
certain
Mystical
and
Spiritual
manner
<error>
but
by
the
Light
of
the
Spirit
let
us
do
our
best
to
comprehend
this
great
mystery
of
the
Beginning
<error>
Let
us
accept
the
term
AIN
as
representing
That
of
which
Nothing
is
known
<error>
nor
can
be
known
<error>
except
through
the
positive
manifestations
which
arise
form
It
<error>
When
we
attempt
to
imagine
the
AIN
SUPH
-
-
Limitless
Space
-
-
our
minds
tend
to
rush
on
and
on
<error>
only
to
fall
back
before
the
Profundity
of
the
Great
Deep
;
yet
we
have
to
admit
the
possibility
of
Infinite
extension
in
space
<error>
In
my
opinion
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
only
able
to
extend
the
<error>
fine
<error>
material
<error>
substance
<error>
of
the
mind
to
a
certain
limit
<error>
after
reaching
which
there
is
NOTHING
for
Us
unless
we
succeed
in
developing
fresh
Power
to
drive
that
limit
further
back
and
so
to
extend
the
actual
substance
of
our
being
accordingly
<error>
If
Life
is
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
the
Life
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
most
subtle
substance
in
our
make
-
up
<error>
while
it
would
follow
that
the
more
this
substance
is
extended
<error>
the
greater
will
be
our
Illumination
<error>
the
further
our
range
of
vision
<error>
and
the
wider
our
Sphere
of
Consciousness
<error>
With
these
thoughts
in
mind
let
us
attempt
to
obtain
a
more
complete
Understanding
of
the
Primal
Process
<error>
which
is
still
<error>
going
on
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
When
the
AIN
SUPH
AUR
became
<error>
concentrated
<error>
upon
a
Single
Center
<error>
it
<error>
compressed
<error>
the
Light
into
the
Substance
of
Light
<error>
which
is
Life
<error>
Or
<error>
in
other
words
<error>
the
Concentrated
Light
became
an
inconceivably
powerful
Force
or
Energy
in
the
center
of
Kether
<error>
This
Pure
Being
<error>
or
Living
Substance
<error>
owing
to
its
reaction
from
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
tends
to
expand
towards
Infinity
<error>
This
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
<error>
ever
occupying
more
and
more
of
the
Limitless
Space
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
while
the
Primal
Centralizing
Urge
still
continues
to
contract
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
the
AIN
<error>
Kether
is
then
the
<error>
junction
<error>
of
these
Two
Infinites
<error>
but
particularly
represents
the
<error>
concentration
<error>
of
the
Light
to
a
Point
on
its
way
to
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
while
Malkuth
<error>
the
Tenth
Sephira
and
Sphere
of
the
Elements
-
-
which
the
Qabalists
say
is
one
with
Kether
-
-
is
the
Substance
which
is
<error>
ever
<error>
expanding
<error>
and
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
gradually
FILLING
UP
THE
NOTHINGNESS
of
the
AIN
SUPH
<error>
So
we
may
consider
Kether
as
the
Light
and
Malkuth
as
the
Substance
<error>
while
the
complete
Sphere
is
composed
of
LIVING
SUBSTANCE
<error>
This
represents
the
Macrocosmic
Universe
<error>
but
it
is
every
BECOMING
GREATER
AND
GREATER
in
extent
<error>
and
driving
back
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
the
Nothingness
of
Chaos
<error>
Man
<error>
being
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
has
the
same
infinite
possibilities
of
growth
in
Consciousness
<error>
as
the
Force
of
the
Spirit
extends
the
substance
of
his
mind
to
wider
and
wider
fields
of
thought
<error>
Yet
the
whole
existing
Universe
is
the
result
of
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
and
it
progresses
according
to
the
Order
of
Pure
Reason
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
Qabalah
<error>
All
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
have
their
place
according
to
this
Order
<error>
<error>
within
<error>
the
Sphere
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
and
represent
the
manifold
possibilities
of
the
action
of
the
Life
Force
upon
that
Substance
and
the
different
manifestations
of
that
Substance
under
the
Influence
of
the
Life
Force
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
WITHOUT
[
i
<error>
e
<error>
outside
]
the
manifested
universe
is
the
Infinite
Body
of
Nuit
;
at
the
CENTER
of
All
is
the
Infinitely
Small
and
unextended
Essence
of
Life
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
The
Contraction
of
Nuit
upon
Hadit
and
the
Expansion
of
Hadit
into
Nuit
are
constant
forces
<error>
The
Finite
Universe
<error>
or
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
is
bounded
by
an
EVER
WIDENING
CIRCUMFERENCE
which
is
always
exactly
BETWEEN
the
Infinitely
Great
and
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
Kether
and
Malkuth
-
-
Spirit
and
Matter
-
-
together
represent
this
Universal
Sphere
<error>
while
Tiphereth
<error>
the
Central
Sphere
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
must
always
correspond
to
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
within
them
;
a
Sphere
HALF
-
WAY
between
the
Center
and
the
Circumference
<error>
In
Nature
we
may
consider
the
finite
representatives
of
these
two
Infinites
to
be
the
smallest
known
particle
of
matter
as
the
Center
<error>
the
widest
expanse
of
the
Star
Universe
as
the
circumference
<error>
and
the
Central
Sun
as
their
child
<error>
In
Man
we
find
all
these
possibilities
<error>
both
infinite
and
finite
<error>
The
true
Center
of
his
being
is
Hadit
whose
representative
is
the
tiny
Spark
of
Pure
Spiritual
Light
;
the
substance
of
his
Mental
Body
is
only
limited
by
the
Bounds
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
these
ever
recede
towards
Infinity
<error>
His
physical
body
is
<error>
however
<error>
quite
small
<error>
while
his
heart
<error>
which
regulates
the
life
of
that
body
<error>
is
in
a
mystical
sense
capable
of
comprehending
the
<error>
Light
in
Extension
<error>
of
the
Sun
of
his
being
<error>
which
is
the
soul
<error>
Thus
Man
is
composed
of
body
<error>
soul
<error>
and
spirit
<error>
and
the
soul
is
the
mediator
between
the
spiritual
and
material
<error>
The
Universe
is
composed
of
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
with
Tiphereth
as
the
Mediator
between
them
<error>
while
<error>
in
a
still
greater
sense
we
may
consider
Nuit
and
Hadit
<error>
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
with
the
Whole
Living
manifested
Universe
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
as
their
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
the
Crowned
Child
and
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
Chapter
I
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
and
Appointing
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
I
will
now
endeavor
to
expound
that
which
has
been
revealed
unto
me
<error>
First
<error>
let
me
state
my
conviction
that
this
Universe
is
the
Perfect
Work
of
a
Perfect
Being
<error>
and
that
any
apparent
imperfections
are
due
to
the
limitations
of
our
finite
consciousness
<error>
so
that
even
these
contribute
to
the
larger
Perfection
of
the
Whole
<error>
Secondly
<error>
I
believe
there
is
a
Supreme
and
Perfect
Order
in
all
things
<error>
in
spite
of
any
apparent
disorder
which
<error>
again
<error>
is
but
the
result
of
restrictions
in
man
himself
<error>
Thirdly
<error>
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
parts
in
subservience
to
the
ends
of
the
Whole
<error>
so
that
that
which
is
most
complex
is
most
perfect
<error>
but
that
this
very
complexity
is
due
to
the
combination
of
a
few
Ultimate
Ideas
which
go
to
make
up
the
One
Thought
of
the
Supreme
Being
<error>
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
perfection
of
the
existing
Universe
is
Progressive
<error>
insofar
as
the
Whole
may
be
said
to
expand
and
become
more
and
more
complex
and
greater
and
greater
in
extent
while
still
in
accord
with
the
One
Order
which
prevails
from
its
most
minute
atom
to
its
inconceivably
vast
circumference
<error>
I
incline
to
believe
that
the
finite
universe
is
not
spherical
<error>
though
tending
ever
to
become
so
as
its
substance
materializes
<error>
In
other
words
that
the
Light
precedes
the
Life
which
is
its
Substance
<error>
and
the
Life
precedes
the
material
which
is
its
substance
<error>
Thus
the
rays
of
Light
may
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
Star
<error>
while
the
Ever
-
becoming
Life
and
material
substance
tend
to
expand
as
a
Sphere
<error>
The
projecting
rays
<error>
so
to
speak
<error>
drive
back
the
primal
chaos
more
easily
than
would
a
smooth
sphere
which
expanded
equally
all
over
its
surface
<error>
That
such
a
conception
implies
at
least
a
possibility
<error>
I
shall
presently
endeavor
to
show
<error>
There
is
another
important
point
which
should
be
mentioned
<error>
The
Spiritual
World
of
Ideas
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Material
World
of
Substance
is
in
Perfect
Order
;
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
and
of
Man
<error>
which
is
the
result
of
these
<error>
is
capable
of
comprehending
that
Order
perfectly
<error>
But
<error>
again
<error>
the
spirit
of
Man
is
perfect
<error>
his
body
is
made
in
the
Image
and
Likeness
of
God
and
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
his
soul
<error>
having
within
it
the
power
of
personal
choice
<error>
or
will
<error>
which
alone
enables
him
to
progress
in
a
free
and
intelligent
manner
<error>
is
at
the
same
time
liable
to
distortion
if
the
personal
will
is
ill
-
used
or
restricted
<error>
In
that
case
the
Eye
of
the
soul
sees
things
out
of
proportion
and
order
<error>
and
this
astigmatism
must
be
corrected
<error>
Otherwise
<error>
man
is
under
an
illusion
<error>
self
-
created
<error>
which
<error>
however
<error>
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
Real
Order
of
the
Universe
<error>
but
merely
tends
to
confine
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
his
due
heritage
in
all
its
fullness
<error>
Thus
the
Great
Work
for
Man
consists
in
the
adjustment
of
the
soul
<error>
or
Intellectual
Sphere
<error>
so
that
it
bears
a
perfect
resemblance
and
correspondence
to
the
Material
and
Natural
Order
of
the
Universe
and
at
the
same
time
exhibits
its
relation
with
the
Supreme
or
Archetypal
Order
<error>
This
possibility
of
distortion
in
the
soul
has
led
him
into
the
direst
troubles
<error>
but
unless
that
soul
were
thus
plastic
it
could
not
expand
and
take
on
the
complex
Design
of
the
Greater
Universe
<error>
Man
<error>
s
work
consists
in
building
up
his
soul
by
means
of
his
personal
will
and
creative
imagination
<error>
under
the
guidance
and
direction
of
the
Will
of
the
Universe
<error>
into
the
same
Archetypal
Pattern
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
One
Thought
of
God
<error>
But
how
shall
man
discover
this
Design
upon
the
Trestleboard
of
the
Grand
Architect
<error>
He
may
at
least
make
an
intelligent
attempt
to
do
so
<error>
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
<error>
Since
perfect
Order
consists
in
a
right
relation
<error>
adjustment
<error>
and
proportion
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Idea
of
the
Whole
<error>
we
must
first
consider
some
of
the
necessary
requirements
of
that
Order
<error>
The
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
of
the
Qabalists
has
been
called
the
<error>
Minutum
Mundum
<error>
or
<error>
Little
Universe
<error>
<error>
and
students
of
the
Qabalah
will
have
become
aware
that
this
system
has
great
possibilities
as
a
convenient
means
of
classification
in
regard
to
every
thing
in
the
Universe
<error>
or
idea
in
the
mind
of
man
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
for
each
one
of
us
<error>
consists
of
what
we
are
able
to
comprehend
of
it
<error>
Some
are
content
to
feel
themselves
at
one
with
a
very
limited
part
;
others
realize
that
if
once
they
could
obtain
the
true
Design
<error>
all
would
become
possible
of
comprehension
in
a
spiritual
manner
<error>
But
this
Design
has
been
lost
<error>
or
so
it
seemed
<error>
In
Book
4
<error>
Part
III
-
-
still
in
ms
<error>
-
-
we
may
read
<error>
<error>
An
excellent
man
of
great
intelligence
<error>
a
learned
Qabalist
<error>
once
amazed
FRATER
PERDURABO
by
stating
that
the
Tree
of
Life
was
the
framework
of
the
Universe
<error>
It
was
as
if
some
one
had
serious
maintained
that
a
cat
was
a
creature
constructed
by
placing
the
letters
C
-
A
-
T
in
that
order
<error>
It
is
no
wonder
that
Magick
has
excited
the
ridicule
of
the
unintelligent
<error>
since
even
its
educated
students
can
be
guilty
of
so
gross
a
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
common
sense
<error>
<error>
I
may
state
that
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
who
this
excellent
man
was
<error>
and
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
the
opinions
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
but
<error>
at
the
risk
of
falling
under
the
same
stigma
as
this
<error>
unknown
warrior
<error>
I
shall
break
a
lance
with
Frater
Perdurabo
on
this
point
<error>
before
this
treatise
is
completed
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
let
me
refer
Students
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
to
the
various
designs
of
the
Tree
of
Life
which
may
be
in
their
possession
<error>
or
readily
available
<error>
Let
us
examine
<error>
for
instance
<error>
those
shown
in
Westcott
<error>
s
<error>
Introduction
to
the
Study
of
the
Kabalah

one

<error>
The

alone
gives
a
well
proportioned
Tree
<error>
It
would
seem
that
this
important
aspect
of
proportion
has
received
little
or
no
attention
in
the
past
<error>
But
let
me
once
again
refer
you
to
the
ancient
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
(
as
I
did
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Paths
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
)
;
in
it
we
are
told
to
<error>
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
to
<error>
Replace
the
Formative
Power
upon
His
Throne
<error>
<error>
or
to
<error>
Restore
the
Device
or
Workmanship
to
its
Place
<error>
<error>
Was
the
author
of
that
old
treatise
using
mere
idle
words
<error>
or
did
he
mean
what
he
said
<error>
It
is
possible
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
this
himself
<error>
since
the
mss
<error>
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
contains
no
diagrams
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
;
but
<error>
in
any
event
<error>
we
may
at
least
attempt
to
follow
his
lead
and
try
<error>
if
possible
<error>
to
discover
more
Light
from
a
study
of
the
<error>
true
<error>
proportions
<error>
of
the
Tree
<error>
The
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
is
entirely
geometrical
<error>
and
as
might
be
expected
<error>
we
find
the
simplest
elements
of
geometry
as
its
basis
<error>
The
Point
<error>
the
Line
<error>
the
Circle
<error>
the
Triangle
<error>
and
Right

angled
figures
<error>
The
proper
method
of
finding
the
correct
centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
and
thus
the
points
connected
by
the
Paths
<error>
is
as
follows
<error>
Upon
a
vertical
straight
line
of
convenient
length
<error>
describe
with
unchanged
compasses
four
circles
<error>
the
center
of
each
being
on
the
line
<error>
the
point
where
the
upper
arc
of
the
lowest
circle
cuts
the
line
forming
the
center
of
the
circle
above
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
Thus
<error>
[
insert
Figure
I
here
]
The
center
of
the
top
circle
gives
the
central
Point
of
Kether
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
first
and
second
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
[
the
intersections
of
the
second
and
third
circles
form
the
centers
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
]
the
center
of
the
third
circle
is
Tiphereth
<error>
the
intersections
of
the
third
and
fourth
circles
indicate
Netzach
and
Hod
<error>
the
center
of
the
fourth
circle
is
Yesod
<error>
and
the
lower
point
of
its
intersection
with
the
vertical
line
is
Malkuth
<error>
This
method
produces
a
perfectly
proportioned
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
the
connecting
Paths
can
all
be
made
by
joining
the
various
points

In
Freemasonry
<error>
Geometry
is
referred
to
as
the
<error>
first
and
noblest
of
the
Sciences
<error>
and
as
<error>
the
head
of
all
learning
<error>
<error>
One
of
the
simplest
figures
is
produced
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
thus
forming
what
is
known
as
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
The
curious
and
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
and
of
the
Rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
have
been
subjects
of
profound
speculation
<error>
and
perhaps
nowhere
have
they
been
better
described
than
in
the
<error>
Magister
-
Mathesios
<error>
by
our
learned
Brother
Sydney
T
<error>
Klein
<error>
I
am
sure
he
will
have
no
objection
if
I
quote
a
few
passages
from
his
work
<error>
which
has
been
one
of
the
means
of
opening
up
before
me
such
marvelous
vistas
<error>
After
discussing
the
properties
of
the
Masonic
Square
<error>
obtained
from
the
right
angled
triangle
by
means
of
mundane
measures
of
3
<error>
4
<error>
and
5
units
to
each
side
<error>
respectively
<error>
he
points
out
that
a
wave
of
wonderful
enthusiasm
must
have
swept
across
the
civilized
world
when
they
first
discovered
that
the
Geometrical
way
of
creating
a
right
angle
as
given
in
Euclid
I
<error>
11
<error>
was
by
means
of
an
equilateral
triangle
<error>
by
joining
the
vertex
with
the
center
of
the
base
<error>
<error>
This
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
he
writes
<error>
<error>
was
the
earliest
symbol
<error>
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
we
know
of
the
Divine
Logos
and
<error>
as
the
Bible
declared
that
the
Universe
was
created
by
the
Logos
(
the
Word
)
so
the
form
of
the
Lodge
which
represents
the
Universe
was
naturally
created
by
means
of
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
A
great
mystery
this
must
have
appeared
to
those
who
<error>
like
the
Hellenic
philosophers
<error>
postulated
that
everything
on
earth
has
its
counterpart
in
heaven
<error>
and
who
<error>
in
their
religious
mysticism
<error>
were
always
looking
for
signs
of
the
transcendental
in
their
temporal
surroundings
<error>
<error>
But
in
what
awe
and
reverence
must
they
have
held
Geometry
when
they
further
found
that
the
Equilateral
Triangle
was
itself
generated
<error>
as
in
the
<error>
first
<error>
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
Science
of
Geometry
was
therefore
based
<error>
by
the
intersection
of
two
circles
<error>
<error>
This
figure
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
a
symbol
of
the
Three
Divine
<error>
personae
<error>
<error>
but
that
part
of
the
figure
which
is
bounded
by
the
arcs
of
the
two
circles
and
which
takes
to
itself
one
-
third
of
each
of
the
two
generating
circles
(
making
its
perifera
exactly
equal
with
that
remaining
to
each
of
the
two
circles
<error>
all
three
therefore
being
<error>
co
-
equal
<error>
)
<error>
and
in
which
the
triangle
is
formed
<error>
was
naturally
held
from
earliest
times
as
the
most
sacred
Christian
emblem
<error>
namely
that
of
<error>
regeneration
<error>
or
<error>
new
<error>
birth
<error>
<error>
To
how
the
extraordinary
reverence
and
high
value
attached
to
this
symbol
<error>
it
is
only
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
fourth
century
onwards
all
Seals
of
Colleges
<error>
Abbeys
and
other
religious
communities
have
been
made
invariably
of
this
form
and
they
continue
to
be
made
so
to
this
day
<error>
It
was
also
in
allusion
to
this
most
ancient
emblem
that
Tertullian
and
the
other
early
Fathers
speak
of
Christians
as
<error>
Pisciculi
<error>
<error>
It
was
called
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
(
Fish
<error>
s
bladder
)
and
named
such
no
doubt
for
the
same
reason
as
led
the
learned
Rabbi
Maimonides
in
the
twelfth
century
<error>
when
dealing
with
a
similar
religious
subject
<error>
to
command
his
hearers
<error>
<error>
When
you
have
discovered
the
meaning
thereof
<error>
do
not
divulge
it
<error>
because
the
people
cannot
philosophize
or
understand
that
to
the
infinite
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sex
<error>
<error>
[

<error>
The
Vesica
Piscis
is
intimately
connected
with
the
discovery
by
Augustus
Caesar
<error>
as
narrated
by
Baronius
<error>
of
a
prophecy
in
one
of
the
Sybilline
books
foretelling
<error>
a
great
event
coming
to
pass
in
the
birth
of
One
who
should
prove
to
be
the
true
<error>
King
of
Kings
<error>
<error>
and
that
Augustus
therefore
dedicated
an
altar
in
his
palace
to
the
<error>
unknown
God
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
Brother
Klein
then
goes
on
to
show
how
the
Vesica
Piscis
was
the
true
foundation
of
Gothic
Architecture
<error>
and
that
its
influence
accounts
for
the
sudden
change
from
the
old
Norman
style
<error>
which
was
based
on
the
properties
of
the
square
rather
than
the
triangle

[

He
the
discloses
some
of
the
great
wonders
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
points
out
<error>
<error>
The
rectangle
formed
by
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
mysterious
figure
in
its
simplest
form
has
several
extraordinary
qualities
;
it
may
be
cut
into
three
equal
parts
<error>
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
its
shorter
sides
<error>
[
insert
Figure
V
here
]
and
these
parts
will
all
be
precisely
and
geometrically
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
figure
<error>
strangely
applicable
to
the
Symbolism
attached
at
that
time
to
the
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
and
this
sub
-
division
may
be
proceeded
with
indefinitely
without
making
any
change
in
the
form
;
however
often
the
operation
is
performed
the
parts
remain
identical
with
the
original
figure
<error>
having
all
its
extraordinary
properties
<error>
and
<error>
no
<error>
other
<error>
rectangle
<error>
can
have
this
curious
property
<error>
It
may
also
be
cut
into
four
equal
parts
by
straight
lines
parallel
to
the
two
sides
<error>
and
again
each
of
these
parts
will
be
exactly
similar
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
<error>
and
the
process
may
be
continued
indefinitely
<error>
the
equilateral
triangle
appearing
everywhere
<error>
[

Figure
VI

]
Once
more
<error>
if
two
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
be
taken
<error>
the
form
of
these
together
is
exactly
similar
geometrically
to
half
the
original
figure
<error>
and
the
equilateral
triangle
again
appears
everywhere
in
both
;
as
in
figure
V
<error>
[

Figure
VII

]
In
Figure
VII
I
have
carried
the
tri
-
sub
-
division
to
the
sixth
degree
<error>
and
to
help
the
eye
I
have
marked
with
darker
lines
one
of
the
tri
-
sub
-
divisions
of
each
degree
;
it
is
only
owing
to
the
above
unique
similarity
that
the
equilateral
triangle
is
again
formed
on
every
part
of
the
base
line
<error>
Again
the
diagonal
is
exactly
double
the
length
of
its
shorter
side
<error>
which
characteristic
is
also
<error>
unique
<error>
and
greatly
increases
its
use
for
plotting
out
designs
<error>
and
this
property
<error>
of
course
<error>
holds
good
for
all
the
rectangles
formed
by
both
species
of
sub
-
division
<error>
but
perhaps
its
most
mysterious
property
(
though
not
of
any
practical
use
)
to
those
who
studied
geometry
<error>
and
to
whom
the
figure
was
a
Symbol
of
the
Divine
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
was
the
fact
that
it
actually
put
into
their
hands
the
means
of
trisecting
the
right
angle
<error>
Now
the
three
great
problems
of
antiquity
which
engaged
the
attention
of
geometricians
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
were
<error>
the
Duplication
of
a
Cube
<error>
<error>
<error>
the
squaring
of
the
circle
<error>
<error>
and
lastly
<error>
<error>
the
trisection
of
an
angle
<error>
<error>
even
Euclid
being
unable
to
show
how
to
do
it
<error>
and
yet
it
will
be
seen
that
the
diagonal
A
-
B
of
Figure
IV
and
the
diagonal
A
-
E
of
the
subsidiary
figure
<error>
which
is
also
the
plumbline
<error>
actually
trisect
the
angle
D
-
A
-
C
<error>
It
is
true
that
it
only
shows
how
to
trisect
one
kind
of
angle
<error>
but
it
was
that
particular
angle
which
represented
the
Craft
and
was
created
by
the
equilateral
triangle
<error>
All
these
unique
properties
place
this
figure
far
above
that
of
a
square
for
practical
work
<error>
because
even
when
the
diagonal
of
a
square
is
given
it
is
impossible
to
find
the
exact
length
of
any
of
its
sides
<error>
or
vice
versa
<error>
<error>
I
have
quoted
Brother
Sydney
Klein
thus
fully
in
order
to
give
him
due
credit
for
his
detailed
working
on
this
most
important
matter
<error>
and
also
to
supply
the
reader
with
a
clear
idea
of
the
unique
features
of
these
symbols
<error>
as
well
as
of
their
deep
religious
significance
and
the
actual
effect
that
their
practical
application
produced
on
all
the
religious
Architecture
of
the
Gothic
period
<error>
On
this
basis
many
of
the
most
important
Cathedrals
and
Churches
were
erected
<error>
and
their
Beauty
is
not
to
be
denied
<error>
When
we
compare
some
of
these
beautiful
Gothic
structures
with
the
Pyramid
<error>
for
instance
<error>
we
cannot
but
notice
the
difference
;
but
after
all
the
Pyramid
is
a
truly
Symbolic
structure
in
every
detail
<error>
while
the
Gothic
Cathedrals
only
show
part
of
the
truth
<error>
Imagine
my
overwhelming
joy
when
I
discovered
that
the
ancient
Qabalistic
Tree
of
Life
<error>
with
all
its
wonderful
possibilities
as
a
means
of
mental
classification
of
every
idea
in
the
Universe
-
-
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
-
-
<error>
was
<error>
in
<error>
its
<error>
entirety
<error>
based
<error>
upon
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
fundamental
<error>
pr
inciple
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
Vesica
<error>
Piscis
<error>
<error>
and
was
therefore
<error>
not
<error>
a
<error>
fixed
<error>
design
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
<error>
progression
<error>
towards
<error>
the
<error>
Infinitely
<error>
Small
<error>
or
<error>
the
<error>
Infini
tely
<error>
Great
<error>
<error>
For
it
can
be
so
drawn
that
it
appears
with
all
its
details
and
properties
<error>
repeating
themselves
indefinitely
in
every
direction
of
Space
to
Infinity
<error>
Imagine
what
it
means
to
a
Qabalist
who
has
arranged
all
the
ideas
in
his
mind
<error>
in
duly
Balanced
and
Equilibrated
formation
<error>
to
discover
a
way
of
perpetuating
in
thought
all
these
Ideas
<error>
and
to
be
able
to
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
upon
which
they
are
based
is
a
LIVING
TREE
<error>
with
its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
and
Fruits
extending
to
the
furthest
Limits
of
the
Universe
<error>
This
is
the
nature
of
the
discovery
<error>
or
revelation
<error>
which
came
to
me
on
April

<error>
unity
<error>
;
whence
he
is
called
the
Thrice
Great
Hermes
<error>
having
the
<error>
spiritual
<error>
intelligence
<error>
of
<error>
all
<error>
things
<error>
in
<error>
their
<error>
universa
l
<error>
law
<error>
It
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
one
of
the
many
books
attributed
to
him
<error>
and
which
are
named
in
detail
by
Clemens
Alexandrinus
<error>
escaped
the
destroying
hand
of
Diocletian
<error>
But
we
have
one
truly
authentic
record
in
the
famous
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
which
contains
the
one
sole
dogma
of
Hermetic
Philosophy
<error>
<error>
That
which
is
above
is
as
that
which
is
below
<error>
and
that
which
is
below
is
as
that
which
is
above
<error>
for
performing
the
miracles
of
the
One
Things
<error>
<error>
The
Emerald
Tablet
<error>
unique
and
authentic
as
it
may
be
regarded
<error>
is
all
that
remains
to
us
from
Egypt
of
her
Sacred
Art
<error>
A
few
riddles
and
fables
<error>
all
more
or
less
imperfect
<error>
that
were
preserved
by
the
Greeks
<error>
and
some
inscrutable
hieroglyphics
<error>
are
still
to
be
found
quoted
in
certain
alchemical
records
;
but
the
originals
are
entirely
lost
<error>
There
is
little
doubt
that
Ancient
Egypt
did
at
one
time
hold
the
true
Key
of
the
Mysteries
<error>
For
what
did
Pythagoras
<error>
Thales
<error>
Democritus
and
Plato
become
immured
there
for
several
solitary
years
<error>
but
to
be
initiated
in
the
wisdom
and
learning
of
those
Egyptians
<error>
Yet
Hermes
himself
is
reported
to
have
prophesied
her
fall
<error>
and
the
loss
of
her
wisdom
and
learning
;
and
this
certainly
was
fulfilled
<error>
But
<error>
as
I
have
endeavored
to
point
out
in
my
treatise
<error>
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
in
this
New
Aeon
<error>
during
this
Aquarian
Age
<error>
man
will
once
more
come
into
his
own
<error>
and
be
directly
informed
by
the
true
Spirit
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
in
a
way
that
has
not
been
possible
for
many
Ages
<error>
At
least
there
seems
every
hope
of
the
revival
of
the
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
<error>
despite
the
present
world
-
crisis
and
the
breaking
up
of
the
old
civilization
<error>
But
it
is
necessary
that
things
should
be
destroyed
in
order
that
they
may
be
renewed
<error>
as
the
Justified
Osiris
said
in
regard
to
His
Body
<error>
So
it
is
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
regard
to
our
pre
-
conceived
ideas
of
the
Body
of
the
Universe
<error>
or
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
or
some
other
pet
theory
;
but
so
long
as
we
receive
something
better
in
exchange
for
that
with
which
we
must
part
<error>
what
matter
!
There
is
certainly
no
denying
the
importance
of
the
<error>
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
as
far
as
Hermes
is
concerned
<error>
for
his
very
title
of
Thrice
Greatest
implies
in
what
veneration
such
conceptions
must
have
been
held
in
his
day
<error>
In
Alchemy
we
find
three
Principles
-
-
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
;
and
Three
great
Stages
of
the
Work
-
-
Discovery
of
the
Formation
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
its
Multiplication
<error>
and
its
Projection
<error>
These
later
stages
have
been
very
little
understood
<error>
In
the
Qabalah
(
from
the
three
-
lettered
root
QBL
<error>
meaning
<error>
to
receive
<error>
)
we
find
mention
of
the
Sacred
Three
Lettered
Name
of
God
IHV
<error>
implying
Father
<error>
Mother
<error>
and
Son
<error>
We
find
three
Mother
Letters
in
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
and
these
are
in
turn
attributed
to
the
Three
Elements
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
which
correspond
to
the
Alchemical
Principles
<error>
and
in
admixture
form
Earth
<error>
or
The
Stone
<error>
We
also
find
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
the
oldest
Qabalistic
treatise
<error>
that
the
<error>
One
created
the
Universe
by
means
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
<error>
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
These
correspond
to
the
Three
Mother
Letters
and
to
the
Three
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
of
the
Tree
<error>
as
I
have
shown
in
<error>
Q

<error>

The
Hindus
venerate
the
Three
-
lettered
Word
AUM
as
the
most
sacred
Name
of
God
;
their
Deity
has
Three
Aspects
as
Brahma
<error>
Vishnu
<error>
and
Shiva
;
the
Creator
<error>
Preserver
<error>
and
Destroyer
<error>
They
postulate
Three
principles
<error>
Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
<error>
or
Activity
<error>
Inertia
<error>
and
Peace
<error>
The
Christians
believe
in
Three
Persons
in
One
God
;
The
Father
<error>
Son
<error>
and
Holy
Spirit
;
in
Three
that
bear
witness
in
Heaven
<error>
and
in
Three
that
bear
witness
on
Earth
<error>
That
man
is
three
-
fold
;
Body
<error>
Soul
<error>
and
Spirit
<error>
In
fact
the
Importance
of
the
Number
Three
<error>
and
of
the
Triangle
<error>
is
a
well
nigh
inexhaustible
subject
<error>
Many
of
these
three
-
fold
Ideas
are
summed
up
in
a
Fourth
<error>
representing
the
Materialized
or
Manifested
aspect
<error>
The
Sides
of
the
Pyramid
are
Triangular
<error>
but
its
Base
is
Square
<error>
The
Word
AUM
is
made
continuous
in
sound
by
the
addition
of
the
nasal
N
<error>
forming
AUMN
<error>
The
Hebrew
IHV
<error>
becomes
IHVH
through
the
addition
of
the
final
He
<error>
or
the
Daughter
<error>
The
Archetypal
<error>
Creative
<error>
and
Formative
Worlds
become
Manifest
in
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
The
tripartite
Word
INR
<error>
becomes
INRI
<error>
The
Trinity
of
Triads
of
the
Tree
of

are
summed
up
in

<error>
Sulphur
<error>
Mercury
<error>
and
Salt
produce

Rajas
<error>
Tamas
<error>
and
Sattva
act
on
Prakriti
<error>
Three
and
Four
together
make
Seven
<error>
another
Sacred
Number
<error>
as
everyone
knows
<error>
Seven
and
three
are
Ten
<error>
and
this
is
said
to
be
the
most
Sacred
and
Complete
of
all
<error>
since
it
represents
a
return
from
One
to
the
Primal
Nothing
of
the
Beginning
<error>
We
find
Ten
Sephiroth
on
the
Qabalistic
Tree
<error>
The
Four
letters
of
the
Sacred
Name
IHVH
<error>
when
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
Triangle
<error>
make
10
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
VIII
here
]
and
this
became
the
basis
of
the
Tetractys
of
Pythagoras
<error>
a
figure
composed
of
Ten
Unit
forms
or
Yods
<error>
[
insert
figure
IX
here
]
But
here
we
begin
to
approach
the
Central
Mystery
once
more
<error>
for
this
Triangle
<error>
with
its
ten
Dots
<error>
gives
us
the
idea
of
the
Division
of
the
triangle
into
others
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
X
here
]
and
so
we
begin
to
get
back
to
our
Equilateral
Triangle
and
Vesica
as
the
Basis
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
But
there
is
another
interesting
fact
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
than
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
so
divided
<error>
having
a
base
of
<error>
say
<error>
three
inches
<error>
will
contain
nine
triangles
<error>
the
sides
of
which
will
each
be
one
inch
<error>
Whereas
a
Square
<error>
whose
side
is
three
inches
<error>
will
also
contain
exactly
the
same
number
of
one
inch
squares
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
<error>
[
insert
figure
XI
here
]
Again
the
numbers
1
-
9
may
be
so
arranged
in
the
nine
squares
<error>
that
they
will
add
to
15
vertically
<error>
horizontally
<error>
and
diagonally
<error>
This
forms
the
basis
for
the
construction
of
the
Magick
Squares
of
the
Planets
<error>
etc
<error>
But
all
these
ideas
are
symbolized
in
the
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
which
we
will
next
examine
in
further
detail
<error>
Chapter
III
The
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
or
Book
of
Formation
<error>
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
philosophical
treatise
as
yet
extent
in
the
Hebrew
language
<error>
opens
as
follows
<error>
<error>
In
the
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of
Hosts
<error>
engrave
his
name
<error>
<error>
<error>
He
created
this
universe
by
the
three
Sepharim
<error>
Number
Writing
<error>
and
Speech
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
;
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
of
the
ineffable
Sephiroth
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
nine
<error>
<error>
<error>
ten
<error>
and
<error>
not
<error>
eleven
<error>
<error>
Learn
this
wisdom
<error>
and
be
wise
in
the
understanding
of
it
;
investigate
these
numbers
<error>
and
draw
<error>
knowledge
<error>
from
them
;
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
and
pass
from
it
to
its
Creator
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
<error>
(
Dr
<error>
Westcott
<error>
s
translation
<error>
)
It
is
well
to
notice
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
made
a
particular
point
of
the
fact
that
there
are
TEN
Sephiroth
<error>
neither
more
nor
less
<error>
If
we
examine
the
formation
of
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
the
following
Figure
(
XII
)
<error>
we
shall
understand
why
they
were
so
careful
to
make
this
plain
<error>
[
insert
figure
XII
here
]
One
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
another
Sephira
in
the
center
of
the
upper
hexagon
<error>
and
this
is
<error>
as
a
matter
of
fact
<error>
the
location
assigned
to
the
Sphere
of
DAATH
<error>
or
Knowledge
<error>
as
the
child
of
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
But
it
is
not
to
be
shown
in
the
plan
of
the
Tree
for
it
represents
a
Higher
Dimensional
Knowledge
<error>
which
should
be
drawn
from
the
whole
Tree
<error>
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
Draw
knowledge
from
the
<error>
<error>
Should
such
a
sphere
be
shown
in
the
design
<error>
it
would
also
necessitate
extra
<error>
Paths
<error>
leading
thereto
<error>
but
we
are
clearly
told
that
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
are
thirty
-
two
in
all
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
the
Ten
Numerical
Emanations
and
their
connecting
links
formed
by
the
Twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
Likewise
we
notice
that
there
are
no
paths
from
2
to
5
and
from
3
to
4
or
from
1
to
4
and
1
to
5
<error>
Had
there
been
<error>
we
should
see
the
symbol
of
the
upright
Pentagram
<error>
which
is
the
Star
of
unconquered
Will
in
the
Microcosm
<error>
united
with
the
Sign
of
the
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
But
this
unification
represents
the
Great
Work
which
must
be
accomplished
by
man
<error>
and
it
is
part
of
the
Universal
Plan
that
he
should
discover
their
equivalence
for
himself
in
order
that
he
may
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Scheme
of
Creation
<error>
Therefor
we
find
an
<error>
Abyss
<error>
<error>
and
no
direct
link
between
Binah
and
Chesed
<error>
[
insert
figure

here
]
Again
<error>
one
might
be
tempted
to
suppose
that
there
should
be
three
averse
equilateral
triangles
<error>
2
-
6
-
3
<error>
4
-
9
-
5
<error>
and
7
-
10
-
8
<error>
But
should
4
-
9
and
5
-
9
be
connected
by
paths
<error>
a
figure
of
the
evil
and
averse
Pentagram
with
its
two
points
uppermost
<error>
would
appear
upon
the
tree
;
thus
<error>
[

here
]
We
must
do
nothing
<error>
then
which
will
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
arrangement
as
it
stands
<error>
for
it
is
a
veritable
Work
of
Wisdom
<error>
Let
us
again
examine
the
arrangement
and
juxtaposition
of
the
Paths
as
shown
in
figure
XII
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Hexagon
bounded
by
1
-
2
-
4
-
6
-
5
-
3
<error>
is
perfect
in
form
;
all
its
sides
are
equal
<error>
That
the
Triangles
2
-
3
-
6
and
7
-

are
perfectly
equilateral

<error>
7
-
9
-

<error>
and
8
-
9
-
10
are
all
equal
and
have
an
angle
of
120
degrees
or
exactly
one
-
third
of
a
circle
<error>
That
the
small
triangles
4
-
6
-
7
and
5
-
6
-
8
are
both
equilateral
<error>
That
the
paths
connecting
6
-
7
-
9
-
8
produce
a
diamond
which
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
perfect
Vesica
<error>
It
should
further
be
noticed
that
the
two
rectangles
<error>
3
-
2
-
4
-
5
and
5
-
4
-
7
-
8
are
each
exactly
based
on
the
proportion
of
the
Vesica
<error>
so
that
they
partake
of
all
the
properties
shown
in
figure
V
<error>
as
explained
in
detail
by
Brother
Klein
<error>
If
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
be
taken
as
the
Length
of
One
Vesica
<error>
the
height
from
the
center
of
Malkuth
to
the
center
of
Kether
is
exactly
the
Width
of
Four
such
Vesicae
<error>
The
Path
from
Kether
to
Tiphereth
is
exactly
equal
to
the
combined
lengths
of
the
two
paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
Further
study
on
the
part
of
the
Student
will
disclose
many
other
proportions

anonymous
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
<error>

important

in

Piscis
and
its
relation
to
the

of

<error>
He

<error>
<error>
It

<error>
both
to

<error>
that
the
mystical
figure
called

<error>
so
popular
in
the
Middle

<error>
and
generally
placed
as
the

their
works
<error>

presumably
because
of
an
unspeakable
mystery
attached
to
it
<error>
these

make
no
reference
to
it
<error>
Thomas
Kerrich
<error>
a
freemason
and
principal
librarian
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
<error>
read
a
paper
upon
this
mystical
figure
before
the
Society
of
Antiquaries
on
January
20
<error>
1820
<error>
He
illustrated
his
remarks
with
many
diagrams
illustrating
its
use
by
the
ancient
masons
<error>
and
piously
concludes
by
saying
<error>
<error>
I
would
by
no
means
indulge
in
conjectures
as
to
the
reference
these
figures
might
possibly
have
to
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion

<error>
Dr
<error>
Oliver
(
<error>
Discrep
<error>
<error>

<error>

)
<error>
speaking
of
the
Vesica
says
<error>
<error>
This
mysterious
figure
Vesica
Piscis
possessed
an
unbounded
influence
on
the
details
of
sacred
architecture
;
and
<error>
it
<error>
constituted
<error>
the
<error>
<error>
great
<error>
<error>
and
<error>
enduring
<error>
secret
<error>
of
<error>
our
<error>
ancient
<error>
brethren
<error>
The
plans
of
religious
buildings
were
determined
by
its
use
;
and
the
proportions
of
length
and
height
were
dependent
on
it
alone
<error>
<error>
Mr
<error>
Clarkson
(
Introductory
Essay
to
Billings
<error>
<error>
Temple
Church
<error>
)
considered
that
the
elementary
letters
of
the
primitive
language
were
derived
from
the
same
mystical
symbol
<error>
He
says
that
it
was
known
to
Plato
and
<error>
his
masters
in
the
Egyptian
colleges
<error>
and
was
to
the
old
builders
<error>
an
archetype
of
ideal
beauty
<error>
<error>
The
Vesica
was
also
regarded
as
a
baneful
object
under
the
name
of
<error>
Evil
Eye
<error>
<error>
and
the
charm
most
generally
employed
to
avert
the
dread
effects
of
its
fascination
was
the
Phallus
(
(
J
<error>
Millinger
<error>
s
<error>
Archeologia
<error>
<error>
XIX
)
<error>
In
Heraldry
<error>
the
Vesica
was
used
as
the
feminine
shield
<error>
It
was
interchangeable
with
the
Fusill
<error>
or
Mascule
<error>
and
was
also
figured
as
a
lozenge
or
rhombus
<error>
In
the
East
the
Vesica
was
used
as
a
symbol
of
the
womb
<error>
and
was
joined
to
the
cross
by
the
Egyptians
forming
the
handle
of
the
Crux
Ansata
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
Vesica
is
constructed
from
two
intersecting
circles
<error>
so
that
it
may
be
taken
as
having
a
double
significance
<error>
Edward
Clarkson
says
it
<error>
means
astronomically
at
the
present
day
a
starry
conjunction
;
and
by
a
very
intelligent
transfer
of
typical
ideas
a
divine
marriage
<error>
<error>
or
the
two
-
fold
essence
of
life
<error>
which
the
ancients
supposed
to
be
male
and
female
<error>
To
every
Christian
the
Vesica
is
familiar
from
its
constant
use
in
early
art
<error>
for
not
only
was
it
an
attribute
of
the
Virgin
<error>
and
the
feminine
aspect
of
the
Savior
as
symbolized
by
the
<error>
wound
<error>
in
his
side
<error>
but
it
commonly
surrounds
the
figure
of
Christ
<error>
as
His
Throne
when
seated
in
Glory
<error>
As
a
hieroglyphic
the
combination
of
Christ
with
the
Vesica
is
analogous
to
the
Crux
Ansata
of
the
Egyptians
<error>
<error>
[

A
little
further
on
in
his
book
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
also
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
<error>
Geometrically
<error>
the
diagram
containing
the
ten
steps
of
the
Cabala
is
shown
by
Kircher
and
other
authorities
in
the
form
ascribed
by
Freemasons
to
what
they
call
the
<error>
Double
Cube
<error>
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
an
irregular
hexagon
<error>
which
will
exactly
enclose
a
Vesica
<error>
Consequently
its
length
and
breadth
are
of
the
proportion
of
26
to
15
<error>
It
is
said
that
the
ten
cabalistic
steps
<error>
in
their
entirety
<error>
symbolize
the
aspect
of
the
Deity
expressed
by
the
four
mystic
letters
IHVH
<error>
whose
numerical
value
is
26
<error>
This
number
was
said
by
the
Jews
to
comprise
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
Law
<error>
No
explanation
<error>
however
<error>
has
ever
been
given
showing
how
the
number
26
afforded
a
key
to
all
the
science
of
the
Israelites
<error>
It
is
now
suggested
that
the
Vesica
<error>
whose
proportion
is
in
the
ration
of
26
to
15
<error>
was
the
symbol
of
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
<error>
by
which
the
synthesis
of
nature
was
reduced
to
a
comprehensible
figure
<error>
capable
of
demonstrating
to
initiates
the
truth
and
knowledge
which
constituted
the
sacred
wisdom
of
antiquity
<error>
<error>
The
last
sentence
is
of
much
interest
in
the
light
of
our
present
researches
<error>
I
had
not
noticed
this
reference
when
first
writing
this
book
<error>
but
it
is
not
alone
a
confirmation
of
our
general
ideas
<error>
but
leads
to
others
of
importance
<error>
Brother
Klein
gives
the
true
proportion
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
as
that
of
8
to
13
<error>
85
<error>
but
probably
the
nearest
in
whole
numbers
is
that
above
given
by
the
author
of
The
Canon
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
15
to
26
<error>
(
I
think
the
exact
proportion
is
15
<error>
01
to
26
<error>
)
Now
these
numbers
26
and
15
are
of
great
Qabalistic
value
<error>
26
<error>
as
stated
by
the
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
<error>
is
the
numeration
of
IHVH
<error>
and
this
<error>
as
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
is
the
<error>
Formula
<error>
upon
which
the
whole
System
is
based
<error>
15
is
the
numeration
of
IH
or
<error>
Jah
<error>
<error>
the
venerable
Name
of
God
<error>
attributed
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
to
the
Creator
Who
devised
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
which
we
are
discussing
<error>
The
author
of
the
<error>
Canon
<error>
makes
a
valuable
suggestion
when
he
remarks
that
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
as
26
to
15
<error>
although
his
statement
is
not
actually
correct
<error>
Qabalistically
<error>
however
<error>
we
may
notice
a
very
interesting
thing
<error>
The
Total
numeration
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
or
the
length
of
the
Tree
<error>
is
1
+
6
+
9
+
10
=
26
<error>
while
the
two
Sephiroth
forming
the
bases
of
the
side
pillars
<error>
and
indicating
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
are
Netzach
=
7
and
Hod
=
8
<error>
thus
7
+
8
=
15
<error>
Now
although
the
Vesica
Piscis
is
the
hidden
rule
or
canon
upon
which
the
figure
is
built
<error>
the
true
proportion
of
the
Tree
is
much
more
wonderful
than
if
its
length
and
breadth
were
in
the
proportion
of
a
simple
Vesica
<error>
As
explained
before
<error>
the
true
proportion
is
that
of
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
four
Vesicae
in
height
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
one
Vesica
in
width
<error>
This
suggests
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
But
since
the
rectangle
bounding
a
Vesica
may
be
divided
into
three
equal
parts
by
lines
parallel
to
the
shorter
sides
<error>
and
the
divisions
thus
formed
are
found
each
to
have
the
same
proportions
as
the
original
figure
<error>
we
shall
also
find
that
three
out
of
the
four
parts
of
the
height
of
the
Tree
of
Life
will
represent
the
exact
length
of
a
Vesica
the
breadth
of
which
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
Tree
from
center
to
center
of
the
Sephiroth
forming
the
side
pillars
<error>
To
make
this
plainer
<error>
if
we
take
the
reciprocal
path
from
Chesed
to
Geburah
as
equivalent
to
26
(
it
being
the
length
of
one
of
the
four
vesicae
and
at
the
same
time
the
width
of
the
Tree
)
and
construct
thereon
another
Vesica
we
shall
find
that
its
highest
and
lowest
points
will
be
in
the
centers
of
Kether
and
Yesod
<error>
Thus
the
first
Nine
Sephiroth
are
in
exact
proportion
of
the
Vesica
and
Malkuth
remains
as
a
pendant
<error>
The
height
of
this
Vesica
will
now
be
45
and
its
width
26
<error>
We
have
examined
the
number
26
as
to
its
mystical
value
<error>
but
45
is
found
to
be
the
mystic
number
of
Yesod
<error>
which
represents
the
generative
organs
<error>
In
addition
to
this
we
find
that
the
sum
of
the
numbers
of
the
Sephiroth
1
-
9
is
45
<error>
and
this
is
the
numeration
of
ADM
the
Hebrew
ADAM
<error>
Further
if
we
notice
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
it
will
be
found
to
have
its
apex
in
Kether
while
the
left
hand
curve
cuts
through
the
center
of
Geburah
and
the
right
hand
curve
through
that
of
Chesed
<error>
both
these
terminating
in
Yesod
<error>
Therefore
these
lines
unite
1
+
4
+
5
+
9
=
19
<error>
Now
19
is
the
numeration
of
ChVH
<error>
or
Chavvah
<error>
which
is
the
Hebrew
word
for
EVE
<error>
Thus
we
find
ADAM
and
EVE
united
;
with
IHVH
in
the
midst
of
their
union
<error>
[

The
fact
that
we
find
these
first
Nine
Sephiroth
forming
a
perfect
Vesica
and
producing
such
symbolism
is
indeed
significant
<error>
and
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
we
find
the
circle
of
Malkuth
below
this
Vesica
<error>
and
that
Malkuth
has
been
referred
to
the
World
of
Shells
or
Excrement
(
Gross
Matter
)
and
has
been
called
The
Un
-
Redeemed
Daughter
<error>
is
indeed
a
startling
piece
of
natural
symbolism
<error>
But
so
far
we
have
a
Vesica
and
a
Sphere
pendant
<error>
and
our
Tree
of
Life
is
not
fully
represented
in
terms
of
Vesicae
<error>
[
insert
figure
XVII
here
]
The
real
mystery
lies
in
the
fact
that
just
as
in
the
first
proposition
of
Euclid
<error>
the
Vesica
is
formed
by
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
circles
<error>
<error>
so
the
true
proportion
of
this
figure
is
found
to
be
that
of
the
<error>
intersection
<error>
of
<error>
two
<error>
Vesicae
<error>
<error>
In
which
case
the
Upright
line
of
the
Middle
Pillar
represents
the
Father
<error>
the
Horizontal
line
which
runs
through
Tiphereth
represents
the
Son
<error>
the
Upper
Vesica
the
Mother
<error>
and
the
lower
one
the
Daughter
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
complete
representation
of
IHVH
in
graphic
form
<error>
and
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Tree
of
Life
are
shown
<error>
The
foregoing
properties
<error>
alone
<error>
make
this
Figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
quite
unique
<error>
but
when
we
add
its
regular
Qabalistic
Correspondences
as
a
symbolic
universal
basis
of
all
Ideas
<error>
and
a
proper
means
of
their
classification
in
perfect
Order
<error>
we
are
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
sublimity
of
the
conception
<error>
But
we
have
hardly
begun
to
consider
its
possibilities
in
other
directions
<error>
We
have
not
as
yet
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Circles
to
the
length
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
this
matter
will
be
taken
up
in
detail
later
on
<error>
Meanwhile
let
us
notice
that
the
connecting
Paths
are
<error>
lines
<error>
<error>
and
the
Sephiroth
<error>
Circles
<error>
(
or
Spheres
)
<error>
The
Line
and
the
Circle
make
up
the
Number
10
<error>
and
also
represent
the
letter
IO
equivalent
to
the
root
of
the
God
-
name
of
Jove
<error>
who
is
identical
with
the
Hebrew
Jehovah
<error>
[

The
proportion
of
the
Sephirotic
Spheres
is
not
again
dealt
with
until
almost
the
end
of
the
book
<error>
But
several
of
the
discoveries
in
the
following
chapters
do
not
work
correctly
except
when
the
proper
proportions
are
used
<error>
The
correct
radius
of
a
Sephirotic
Sphere
is
one
-
fourth
the
radius
of
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
The
correct
width
of
the
Paths
is
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
or
one
-
eighth
the
radius
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
]
Let
us
consider
some
of
the
statements
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
in
greater
detail
<error>
Firstly
we
find
the
words
<error>
In
two
and
thirty
most
occult
and
wonderful
paths
of
wisdom
<error>
did
IAH
<error>
the
Lord
of

<error>
engrave
his
name

<error>
Let
us
consider
the
words

<error>
and
<error>
thirty
<error>
<error>
Two
is
the
numeration
of
the
letter
Beth
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Mercury
or
Wisdom
<error>
and
to
the
Magician

Occultists

controls
the
elemental

It
is
also
the
letter
of
Libra
or
of
Justice
and
Balance
<error>
so
here
in
one
letter
we
get
the
idea
of
the
Scales
with
the
tongue
of
the
balance
(
or
ox
-
goad
)
between
them
<error>
The
letters
BL
in
Hebrew
form
the
word
meaning
<error>
Lord
<error>
<error>
while
LB
means
<error>
Mind
<error>
or

Heart
<error>
<error>
The
Mind
is
the
receptacle
of
Wisdom
and
the
Heart
of

The
number
32
is
the
numeration
of
AHIH
the
Divine
Name
of
Kether
<error>
and
IHVH
the
Ineffable
Name
ruling
the

Nine
Sephiroth

in
the
Great
Name
AHIHVH

The
Name
IAH
is
in
Hebrew
Yod
-
He
or
IH
and
this
is
called
the
Monogram
of
the
Eternal
<error>
The
letters
are
the
first
two
of
IHVH
and
represent
the
Father
and
Mother
conjoined
and
concealing
the
Son
(
A

within
them

Yod
is
the
letter
of
Fire

He
of

the

are
the
natures

<error>
Writing

<error>
Writing
flows

these
are
all

the
Perfect

line
and
a
circle
<error>
for
purposes
of
reproduction
and
transmission
of
form
and
substance
<error>
Thus
we
have
the
idea
<error>
IH
<error>
once
more
<error>
Speech
cometh
from
the
Opening
and
Closing
of
the
Mouth
<error>
thus
by
the
combined
ideas
of
1
and
0
or
10
<error>
In
the
Tarot
the
Letter
Aleph
(
1
)
is
that
of
Air
<error>
and
also
of
The
Fool
<error>
which
is
marked
Zero
<error>
or
0
<error>
Aleph
is
the
Ox
;
Lamed
<error>
as
mentioned
above
<error>
is
the
Ox
-
goad
<error>
together
they
are
AL
<error>
the
most
sacred
Name
of
the
One
God
<error>
and
LA
which
means
<error>
Not
<error>
or
Zero
which
is
0
<error>
AL
is
numerically
31
<error>
suggesting
the
Three
Sepharim
in
One
and
3
+
1
=
4
;
and
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
-
4
=
10
<error>
<error>
Ten
are
the
numbers
<error>
as
are
the
Sephiroth
<error>
and
twenty
-
two
the
letters
<error>
these
are
the
Foundation
of
all
things
<error>
<error>
Twenty
is
the
numeration
of
the
basic
simple
Hebrew
Letter
or
IOD
<error>
spelt
in
full
<error>
Beth
(
2
)
is
the
House
or
Womb
<error>
Yod
is
equivalent
to
the
spermatozoon
in
one
sense
<error>
Twenty
is
also
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
Letter
Kaph
which
means
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
act
of
grasping
<error>
Yod
also
means
the
Hand
<error>
So
we
have
the
chief
instrument
of
action
<error>
the
hand
<error>
in
the
act
of
opening
and
closing
<error>
representing
expansion
and
contraction
<error>
22
is
the
numeration
of
the
word
IChD
which
means
Unity
<error>
<error>
Of
these
letters
<error>
three
are
mothers
<error>
seven
are
double
<error>
and
twelve
are
simple
<error>
<error>
We
have
mentioned
the
three
Mother
Letters
under
the
form
of
the
Three
Sepharim
<error>
These
represent
the
Three
Elements
<error>
which
combined
<error>
form
Earth
<error>
The
Seven
Double
letters
are
assigned
to
the
Seven
Planetary
Intelligences
<error>
the
Forces
which
govern
Nature
;
and
the
Twelve
Simple
letters
are
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
or
Circle
of
Life
<error>
which
represents
the
great
Star
Universe
<error>
Thus
in
the
twenty
-
two
letters
we
have
the
basis
of
all
Universal
Ideas
<error>
The
One
Substance
with
its
three
Elementary
divisions
combining
in
material
form
;
the
Planets
and
Solar
System
<error>
the
Star
Universe
<error>
all
permeated
with
the
One
Life
which
is
the
Subtle
Substance
of
Light
Itself
<error>
The
Three
Mother
Letters
are
equivalent
to
the
Three
Primary
Colors
<error>
which
break
up
into
the
Seven
Colors
of
the
Rainbow
<error>
and
may
be
further
divided
into
Twelve
<error>
So
the
Paths
of
the
Tree
represent
all
the
Colors
between
Light
and
Darkness
<error>
and
<error>
of
course
<error>
a
host
of
other
ideas
as
may
be
found
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
Book
777
<error>
The
Book
of
Hermes
<error>
or
Thoth
<error>
called
the
Tarot
<error>
contains
Twenty
-
two
symbolic
Designs
<error>
which
have
been
attributed
to
these
Paths
<error>
and
thus
we
may
read
in
them
the
ancient
Tradition
by
means
of
this
Universal
Alphabet
of
Symbols
<error>
as
shown
in
my
treatise
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
<error>
The
ten
numbers
formed
from
nothing
<error>
are
the
Decad
;
these
are
seen
in
the
fingers
of
the
hands
<error>
five
on
one
<error>
five
on
the
other
<error>
and
over
them
is
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
(
as
of
Abraham
)
<error>
<error>
The
Ten
Sephiroth
were
said
to
have
come
from
the
AIN
or
Nothing
;
we
have
made
some
explanation
of
this
in
the
Introduction
<error>
Reference
is
again
made
to
the
<error>
hands
<error>
(
which
connect
the
idea
of
the
Paths
with
that
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
as
shown
above
)
<error>
The
hands
represent
the
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
or
balanced
ideas
<error>
but
these
must
always
be
united
to
find
the
point
of
equilibrium
<error>
They
also
represent
two
Pentagrams
<error>
or
the
Divine
and
Human
Wills
<error>
When
united
in
the
strong
grip
of
the
Lion
<error>
these
two
five
-
fold
stars
meet
in
fellowship
and
harmony
<error>
as
10
<error>
The
peculiar
statements
about
the
Covenant
by
voice
spiritual
<error>
and
the
rite
of
Circumcision
<error>
corporeal
<error>
are
worthy
of
study
<error>
The
Ideas
are
those
of
the
great
opposites
<error>
Spirit
and
Matter
<error>
which
are
ever
United
in
the
Sun
of
the
Soul
<error>
But
again
the
<error>
voice
<error>
requires
the
opening
of
the
<error>
mouth
<error>
thus
changing
the
horizontal
line
into
a
circle
<error>
The
rite
of
circumcision
has
the
effect
of
cutting
away
the
<error>
circle
<error>
of
the
foreskin
<error>
and
disclosing
the
<error>
vertical
line
<error>
upon
the
head
of
the
male
organ
<error>
The
organ
itself
represents
a
line
<error>
either
vertical
or
horizontal
<error>
and
this
<error>
rite
<error>
was
for
the
purpose
of
making
this
organ
safe
from
possible
impurity
<error>
when
connected
with
the
<error>
Circle
<error>
<error>
This
act
again
is
symbolic
of
the
descent
(
or
ascent
)
of
Spirit
into
Matter
<error>
or
the
Harmonious
union
of
Fire
and
Water
<error>
producing
Air
<error>
which
is
in
turn
the
representative
of
the
<error>
Soul
<error>
or
Mediator
<error>
With
all
this
truly
wonderful
symbolism
attached
to
the
number
10
<error>
it
is
hardly
surprising
<error>
if
for
no
other
reason
<error>
that
the
next
verse
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
makes
it
so
clear
that
the
Sephiroth
are
Ten
<error>
and
not
nine
or
eleven
<error>
But
this
verse
also
tells
us
that
after
investigating
these
numbers
<error>
we
must
<error>
fix
the
design
in
its
purity
<error>
<error>
so
it
is
time
we
returned
to
our
discussion
of
that
subject
<error>
Chapter
IV
We
should
remember
that
just
as
the
Soul
is
the
link
between
Body
and
Spirit
<error>
so
is
the
Sun
between
Earth
and
Heaven
<error>
and
the
Great
Central
Sun
between
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
This
Link
between
the
Opposites
is
an
all
-
important
one
<error>
but
it
may
be
equally
a
Devil
or
Redeemer
<error>
according
to
the
Influence
it
has
upon
us
<error>
I
have
showed
this
more
fully
elsewhere
<error>
and
shall
refer
to
it
again
<error>
Now
we
found
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
symbolized
a
set
of
Universal
Ideas
<error>
including
all
Colors
<error>
Likewise
we
shall
find
that
the
Ten
Sephiroth
have
a
corresponding
symbolism
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
the
10
th
Sephira
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
(
corresponding
to
the
Mother
Letters
)
;
the
next
Seven
above
Malkuth
are
attributed
to
the
Solar
System
(
or
Planets
<error>
the
Double
Letters
)
;
Chokmah
<error>
the
next
higher
<error>
is
the
Sphere
of
the
Zodiac
or
Fixed
Stars
;
and
Kether
is
the
Pure
Light
and
the
Source
of
All
as
the
Primum
Mobile
or
First
Motion
<error>
So
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
Ten
Sephiroth
are
equal
to
the
Twenty
-
two
Paths
<error>
and
in
order
to
Fix
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
we
must
be
able
to
arrange
these
Diverse
Sets
of
Ideas
so
that
they
blend
together
perfectly
<error>
That
at
first
may
seem
like
an
impossibility
;
in
fact
for
several
hundred
years
the
Qabalists
have
adopted
an
arrangement
which
entirely
failed
to
produce
this
perfect
Harmony
and
Order
<error>
How
I
was
led
to
discover
such
an
arrangement
<error>
has
been
fully
shown
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
written
last
year
<error>
and
its
further
proof
is
given
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
to
which
I
may
refer
those
interested
<error>
The
following

completed
results
of
those
investigations

It
will
be
seen
that
the
Paths
of
the
Middle
Pillar
are
made
by
the
Three
Mother
Letters
<error>
which
by
shape
form
the
Caduceus
of
Mercury
<error>
and
these
descending
from
Kether
through
the
Sun
and
Moon
(
Tiphereth
and
Yesod

produce
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
or
Malkuth
<error>
All
the
Planetary
Letters
except
Kaph
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
Jupiter
<error>
the
Father
of
the
Gods
<error>
IO
<error>
will
be
seen
to
connect
their
Paths
with
the
corresponding
Planetary
Sephiroth
<error>
The
Twelve
Letters
attributed
to
the
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
will
each
be
found
united
with
the
Sephira
of
its
Ruling
Planet
<error>
even
in
cases
such
as
Gemini
and
Virgo
which
are
both
ruled
by
Mercury
;
Libra
and
Taurus
both
ruled
by
Venus
;
etc
<error>
The
one
apparent
exception
(
on
account
of
the
fact
that
all
four
paths
leading
to
Chesed
are
properly
occupied
)
is
the
case
of
Jupiter
<error>
But
Jupiter
<error>
being
the
direct
representative
of
Kether
<error>
and
also
by
Tarot
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
<error>
which
exactly
symbolizes
the
Primum
Mobile
<error>
could
not
possibly
be
better
placed
in
any
case
<error>
The
fact
that
this
Reformation
of
the
Paths
produces
a
wealth
of
fresh
Symbolism
and
actually
discloses
the
long
lost
Universal
Tradition
(
as
shown
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
is
alone
sufficient
justification
for
changing
the
arrangement
<error>
even
though
it
may
upset
the
ideas
of
certain
people
who
have
based
the
Rituals
of
their
Secret
Orders
upon
the
old
plan
<error>
But
the
Book
of
the
Law
<error>
Liber
Legis
<error>
clearly
states
<error>
<error>
Abrogate
are
all
Rituals
<error>
all
words
and

;

(

<error>
)
But
this
becomes
even
more
essential
when
we
recognize
the
necessity
of
Harmonizing
the
Paths
with
the
Sephiroth
as
explained
above
<error>
and
<error>
Success
is
thy
proof
<error>
<error>
since
this
change
has
led
to
such
marvelous
fresh
developments
as
will
be
seen
before
this
book
is
concluded
<error>
We
may
remark
<error>
to
Qabalists
<error>
that
this
represents
the
true
reconciliation
of
the
<error>
Snake
<error>
and
the
<error>
Sword
<error>
<error>
thus
removing
both
the
<error>
tempter
<error>
and
the
<error>
avenger
<error>
from
the
Gate
of
Eden
;
to
which
we
should
now
be
able
to
return
in
safety
<error>
to
our
great
joy
and
comfort
<error>
To
return
once
more
to
the
<error>
discovery
<error>
of
April
14
th
<error>
and
the
events
which
led
up
to
it
<error>
I
had
been
considering
the
Sun
and
all
that
It
means
to
Humanity
;
how
it
is
indeed
the
Golden
Key
to
the
Soul
of
the
World
<error>
for
this
One
Symbol
contains
in
itself
all
<error>
Trinities
<error>
of
Symbolism
<error>
To
the
Soul
of
Mankind
it
has
meant
in
the
past
all
that
is
<error>
good
<error>
<error>
all
that
is
<error>
evil
<error>
<error>
and
all
that
is
Divine
and
above
these
<error>
according
to
the
view
taken
by
Man
himself
<error>
The
Sun
is
the
True
Son
but
the
False
Father
<error>
He
is
the
Father
of
this
Planet
<error>
but
the
Son
of
the
Star
Universe
by
its
invisible
Father
<error>
Those
who
worship
the
Sun
(
or
Son
)
but
fail
to
pass
ON
to
the
concealed
father
<error>
fall
into
<error>
Sin
<error>
which
is
Restriction
<error>
Those
who
obtain
<error>
Solar
Dhyana
<error>
and
go
no
further
<error>
become
fanatics
<error>
however
wonderful
their
illumination
may
seem
<error>
Thus
the
Sun
is
at
once
an
Angel
of
Light
<error>
the
Devil
<error>
and
the
Redeemer
<error>
For
the
Son
spake
truly
when
He
said
<error>
No
man
cometh
unto
the
Father
but
by
me
<error>
<error>
but
the
worship
and
Deification
of
the
Son
in
place
of
the
Father
has
proved
fatal
enough
to
those
who
misunderstood
<error>
With
these
<error>
and
many
similar
thoughts
in
mind
<error>
I
was
contemplating
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
when
I
thought
of
the
idea
of
temporarily
removing
the
supports
and
reciprocal
paths
<error>
and
leaving
the
Sun
connected
with
the
Sephiroth
by
means
of
direct
rays
<error>
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XX
here
]
I
then
noticed
a
very
interesting
fact
;
that
if
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
on
the
pivot
of
the
Sun
<error>
the
other
Sephiroth
were
revolved
and
united
<error>
the
result
would
be
as
follows
<error>
Kether
would
swing
round
and
exactly
cover
Malkuth
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
(
Wisdom
and
Understanding
)
would
unite
and
swing
down
so
that
their
Circumference
exactly
half
covered
Malkuth
and
Kether
<error>
forming
a
Vesica
as
in
the
first
problem
of
Euclid
<error>
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
would
all
swing
down
and
cover
Yesod
<error>
so
that
the
whole
figure
would
fold
up
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXI
here
]
This
suggested
to
my
mind
<error>
the
idea
of
One
Cell
;
first
in
the
process
of
Division
<error>
and
then
Divided
except
for
a
ray
of
Influence
between
the
two
<error>
In
other
Words
the
Supreme
Light
one
with
Matter
<error>
dividing
through
Wisdom
and
Understanding
<error>
and
becoming
the
Moon
(
Yesod
)
and
the
Sun
(
Tiphereth
)
<error>
Or
<error>
The
Sun
and
Moon
uniting
and
producing
other
symbolic
ideas
-
-
who
can
say
<error>
Then
<error>
seeing
the
Vesica
thus
formed
<error>
I
was
led
to
consider
its
relation
to
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
general
<error>
and
seeing
all
folded
up
between
Tiphereth
and
Malkuth
<error>
I
especially
noticed
the
Paths
from
Netzach
to
Yesod
<error>
and
from
Hod
to
Yesod
<error>
and
saw
that
if
these
were
produced
to
that
they
crossed
each
other
as
far
as
the
lower
part
of
the
Circumference
of
Yesod
<error>
they
would
become
the
Generating
Paths
of
another
small
<error>
Tree
<error>
which
would
exactly
extend
from
the
Center
of
Yesod
(
as
its
Kether
)
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
Circumference
of
Malkuth
(
as
its
Malkuth
)
<error>
thus
bringing
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Little
Tree
<error>
exactly
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
in
the
Larger
one
<error>
and
Tiphereth
of
the
Small
one
exactly
on
the
upper
line
of
the
circumference
of
the
larger
Malkuth
<error>
It
must
be
remarked
that
Yesod
is
said
to
be
the
representative
of
the
Generative
Organs
<error>
when
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
in
regard
to
its
correspondence
to
man
<error>
and
that
Netzach
and
Hod
represent
the
twin
Spheres
connected
therewith
<error>
Thus
the
discovery
that
these
produced
a
<error>
New
Tree
<error>
was
startling
enough
<error>
till
I
began
to
realize
that
this
process
would
go
on
indefinitely
<error>
the
<error>
Trees
<error>
giving
birth
to
smaller
and
smaller
ones
toward
the
Infinitely
Small
or
<error>
conversely
<error>
expanding
into
greater
and
greater
ones
without
Limit
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Thus
the
Tree
was
the
veritable
Representative
of
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
Lord
of
the
Aeon
<error>
the
Ever
Coming
Son
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
Therewith
I
gave
Praise
unto
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
and
became
Silent
as
Harpocrates
<error>
the
twin
of
Horus
which
is
hidden
within
Him
<error>
And
I
did
well
to
be
silent
<error>
for
there
was
much
more
to
be
discovered
(
though
I
could
not
conceive
it
at
the
time
)
<error>
So
I
put
aside
the
sketch
of
my
first
rough
working
<error>
having
signed
and
dated
it
<error>
and
left
the
matter
alone
for
a
while
<error>
Herewith
I
include
a
drawing
made
from
this
first
sketch
<error>
as
a
record
of
the
discovery
<error>
[

Chapter
V
We
may
now
begin
to
understand
what
was
meant
by
the
next
few
words
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
<error>
But
we
may
turn
aside
for
a
moment
<error>
at
this
point
<error>
and
consider
the
old
system
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
as
perpetuated
and
expounded
by
the
best
commentators
of
the
past
<error>
Mention
is
made
of
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
These
are
called
Atziluth
<error>
the
Archetypal
World
;
Briah
<error>
the
Creative
World
;
Yetzirah
<error>
the
Formative
World
;
and
Assiah
<error>
the
Material
World
<error>
These
have
been
attributed
to
the
Four
Letters
of
the
Ineffable
Name
IHVH
<error>
Sometimes
these
worlds
have
been
allotted
to
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
follows
<error>
Atziluth
and
Yod
(
the
Father
)
to
Chokmah
;
Briah
and
He
(
the
Mother
)
to
Binah
;
Yetzirah
and
Vau
(
the
Son
)
to
Tiphereth
as
the
King
ruling
over
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Yesod
(
thus
embracing
six
Sephiroth
)
;
and
finally
Assiah
<error>
as
the
Daughter
or
second
He
<error>
to
Malkuth
<error>
In
this
plan
<error>
Kether
<error>
seems
to
have
no
place
<error>
Again
<error>
sometimes
the
whole
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
considered
as
if
it
were
represented
on
Four
Planes
<error>
one
above
the
other
<error>
or
interpenetrating
each
other
<error>
In
this
case
we
get
40
Sephiroth
<error>
Ten
for
each
World
;
and
for
purposes
of
classification
each
Sephira
was
considered
to
contain
another
complete
tree
<error>
so
as
to
make
in
all
400
<error>
with
a
correspondingly
great
number
of
paths
<error>
This
plan
seems
to
have
been
little
used
for
practical
purposes
;
it
is
<error>
of
course
<error>
very
complicated
and
difficult
to
conceive
on
Four
Planes
at
the
same
time
<error>
The
only
other
attempt
<error>
that
I
am
aware
of
<error>
was
to
place
the
Diagram
of
one
Tree
above
the
other
<error>
so
that
the
Kether
of
the
Lowest
touched
the
Malkuth
of
the
next
<error>
and
so
on
with
the
other
two
higher
Worlds
<error>
Such
an
arrangement
is
shown
in
Mathers
<error>
Kaballah
Unveiled
<error>
<error>
where
the
influences
from
the
Archetypal
World
are
shown
descending
<error>
by
means
of
arrows
running
along
the
Paths
of
the
Flaming
Sword
(
but
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
there
is
no
connecting
path
from
Binah
to
Chesed
on
the
Tree
)
<error>
and
then
through
the
Creative
and
Formative
Worlds
to
Assiah
<error>
where
the
current
ended
in
Malkuth
of
the
Lowest
Tree
<error>
But
no
one
seems
to
have
shown
a
LIVING
TREE
with
Its
Roots
in
the
Infinitely
Small
and
its
Branches
spreading
out
to
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
Yet
it
is
called
the
TREE
OF
LIFE
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
in
the
past
<error>
it
has
been
little
better
than
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
One
can
only
account
for
Attainment
by
the
Old
System
<error>
as
by
the
Grace
of
God
<error>
The
<error>
Paths
<error>
wrongly
arranged
(
but
the
Sephiroth
-
-
corresponding
to
Grades
-
-
fortunately
in
perfect
Order
)
were
confusing
rather
than
illuminating
;
the
method
of
progress
leading
to
the
Horrors
of
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
between
Chesed
and
Binah
<error>
However
<error>
that
makes
little
difference
if
my
surmise
is
correct
(
as
explained
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
)
that
during
this
Aeon
<error>
Wisdom
and
Understanding
are
directly
projected
upon
the
Children
of
Earth
<error>
and
the
Abyss
definitely
Bridged
<error>
But
to
return
to
the
further
development
of
this
wonderful
Plan
<error>
On
Monday
<error>
April
16
<error>
I
had
occasion
to
visit
a
friend
and
Brother
<error>
who
is
a
cunning
craftsman
and
designer
<error>
He
is
a
man
of
much
intelligence
<error>
but
not
a
deep
Student
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
his
interest
in
this
matter
having
dated
from
a
cursory
reading
of
<error>
The
Essence
of
the
Practical
Qabalah
<error>
followed
by
some
study
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
a
few
weeks
ago
<error>
I
was
impressed
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
New
Plan
<error>
and
found
that
he
grasped
its
possibilities
at
once
<error>
We
discussed
it
for
some
time
and
made
a
temporary
sketch
similar
to
the
one
I
first
drew
(
Fig
<error>
XXI
)
<error>
He
offered
to
make
me
a
careful
drawing
showing
several
progressions
<error>
The
following
day
I
called
upon
him
again
<error>
when
we
made
some
further
experiments
together
<error>
and
discussed
the
proper
proportion
of
the
Diameters
of
the
Sephiroth
in
their
relation
to
the
Paths
<error>
It
was
noticed
that
the
Paths
from
Chesed
to
Tiphereth
<error>
and
from
Geburah
to
Tiphereth
<error>
would
generate
a
similar
<error>
Tree
<error>
between
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
in
addition
to
the
one
between
Yesod
and
Malkuth
<error>
Then
he
was
illuminated
by
the
Idea
that
an
intermediate
<error>
Tree
<error>
extending
from
the
Center
of
Tiphereth
to
the
Center
of
Malkuth
should
be
formed
<error>
and
another
one
half
the
size
<error>
between
the
Center
of
Yesod
and
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
This
Idea
produced
startling
results
<error>
The
Second
Tree
was
exactly
Half
the
Height
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Third
<error>
Half
that
of
the
Second
(
perfect
octaves
)
<error>
The
Size
of
the
Sephiroth
should
progress
accordingly
<error>
and
be
based
upon
the
original
generating
Circles
of
the
whole
Tree
<error>
It
was
then
found
that
the
Kether
of
the
Second
was
in
the
Center
of
the
Tiphereth
of
the
First
<error>
and
its
Tiphereth
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
while
its
Malkuth
was
in
the
First
Malkuth
<error>
The
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
had
its
Kether
in
the
Yesod
of
the
First
<error>
and
the
Tiphereth
of
the
Second
;
while
its
Malkuth
was
again
in
the
Center
of
the
Malkuth
of
Both
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
CENTER
of
MALKUTH
represented
the
INFINITELY
SMALL
<error>
and
the
Triple
Trees
went
on
Increasing
in
Size
by
octaves
to
Infinity
<error>
while
MALKUTH
continued
to
EXPAND
about
its
OWN
CENTER
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
will
show
this
marvelous
Plan
in
great
clearness
of
detail
<error>
At
this
point
we
must
clearly
realize
that
since
the
Plan
of
the
Thirty
-
two
Paths
of
Wisdom
is
ever
increasing
in
orderly
progression
towards
the
Infinitely
Great
<error>
or
Nuit
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
contracting
in
the
same
proportions
towards
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
or
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Father
of
All
<error>
it
is
no
longer
proper
for
us
to
talk
of
the
Influence
as
ascending
or
descending
<error>
But
<error>
since
the
extremely
minute
is
more
quickly
lost
to
view
<error>
and
on
account
of
the
inconvenience
and
difficulty
of
making
a
drawing
of
a
very
small
size
<error>
we
must
start
from
a
Central
Point
in
Malkuth
<error>
and
discuss
the
subject
as
if
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
were
increasing
in
size
from
that
Point
<error>
Thus
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
we
shall
now
call
the
smallest
visible
Tree
in
our
Design
<error>
the
First
<error>
the
next
larger
<error>
the
Second
<error>
and
so
on
for
the
necessary
number
of
progressions
<error>
The
Central
Dot
in
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
represents
Hadit
<error>
This
should
be
considered
as
an
unextended
Point
of
Light
or
Pure
Essence
of
Being
<error>
the
true
complement
of
the
Infinitely
Great
and
unknown
Body
of
Nuit
which
is
beyond
our
utmost
conception
of
the
expansion
of
the
Greatest
Tree
we
can
imagine
<error>
The
small
Circle
around
this
<error>
Point
<error>
is
Malkuth
of
the
First
Tree
<error>
and
the
Tree
itself
may
<error>
for
convenience
<error>
be
considered
as
<error>
growing
<error>
up
<error>
out
<error>
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
just
like
any
other
tree
in
proper
soil
<error>
The
True
Kether
is
concealed
within
this
as
the
Essence
of
Life
and
Form
is
within
the
Seed
<error>
When
we
reach
the
<error>
Manifested
Kether
<error>
of
the
First
Tree
it
will
be
very
much
like
the
<error>
most
<error>
perfect
<error>
fruit
containing
within
it
the
<error>
seed
<error>
of
further
progression
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
as
<error>
descending
<error>
from
<error>
Kether
<error>
<error>
but
now
that
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
grows
to
Infinity
<error>
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
starting
point
at
the
Top
<error>
so
as
to
work
downwards
<error>
We
must
start
from
the
Center
and
work
outwards
and
upwards
<error>
It
will
not
be
possible
for
me
to
give
all
the
details
of
this
marvelous
plan
<error>
but
I
may
point
out
a
few
interesting
features
<error>
leaving
the
Student
to
add
the
results
of
his
own
researches
<error>
as
time
goes
on
<error>
I
am
of
course
adopting
the
<error>
Reformulated
Plan
of
the
Paths
<error>
but
some
may
prefer
to
arrange
them
otherwise
;
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
general
geometrical
design
<error>
The
Correspondences
of
Attributions
of
the
First
Tree
will
therefore
remain
exactly
the
same
as
previously
given
<error>
Each
aspirant
will
have
to
fulfill
the
necessary
requirements
of
mastering
the
<error>
Ideas
<error>
connected
therewith
<error>
as
before
<error>
He
will
have
to
Attain
<error>
as
formerly
<error>
before
the
Fuller
Consciousness
comes
to
him
;
but
there
are
additional
<error>
clues
<error>
to
his
progress
which
are
most
valuable
<error>
For
instance
<error>
If
he
commences
his
Journey
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
the
Pure
Fool
<error>
leading
from
Malkuth
to
Yesod
<error>
when
he
has
traveled
<error>
half
-
way
<error>
up
this
Path
<error>
he
will
obtain
an
additional
influx
of
Power
from
the
corresponding
Path
on
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
He
will
have
reached
the
circumference
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
<error>
On
arrival
in
Yesod
<error>
he
will
have
contacted
the
circumference
of
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Let
us
consider
his
progress
up
the
Central
Pillar
first
;
supposing
it
to
be
possible
for
him
thus
to
travel
in
perfect
equilibrium
from
the
start
<error>
On
the
Path
of
Mem
or
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
<error>
which
is
attributed
to
<error>
Water
<error>
<error>
he
will
receive
the
additional
Power
of
the
<error>
Air
<error>
from
the
Path
of
Aleph
in
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
till
he
reaches
the
First
Tiphereth
<error>
That
is
to
say
<error>
for
instance
<error>
he
will
find
a
greater
use
for
Pranayama
;
and
so
on
<error>
But
before
he
enters
Tiphereth
he
will
already
be
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
Influence
of
the
Yesod
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
which
he
will
have
contacted
after
crossing
the
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
or
Taurus
<error>
All
the
way
from
the
First
Yesod
to
<error>
The
Abyss
<error>
he
will
be
receiving
the
still
higher
power
of
Aleph
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
As
he
beings
his
ascent
from
the
First
Tiphereth
he
will
do
so
by
the
Path
of
<error>
Shin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Great
Judgment
<error>
<error>
This
is
the
Way
of
the
Triple
Spirit
and
of
Fire
<error>
but
thereon
he
will
also
feel
the
influence
of
<error>
The
Hanged
Man
<error>
from
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
as
well
as
from
<error>
The
Fool
<error>
of
the
<error>
Third
<error>
<error>
On
crossing
the
<error>
Path
of
Death
<error>
he
will
leave
behind
him
the
influence
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
but
half
-
way
across
the
Abyss
he
will
contact
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
of
the
<error>
Second
<error>
<error>
and
at
the
same
moment
enter
the
sphere
of
<error>
Yesod
<error>
of
<error>
the
<error>
Third
<error>
Tree
<error>
<error>
Next
<error>
he
will
cross
the
Path
of
the
<error>
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
<error>
on
the
primary
Tree
<error>
contacting
immediately
the
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
of
Tree
Number
Two
<error>
through
the
aura
of
which
he
passes
on
to
the
<error>
First
<error>
Kether
<error>
Attainment
<error>
During
this
journey
up
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
his
original
Malkuth
will
have
doubled
in
diameter
on
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
doubled
again
when
he
reached
Yesod
<error>
again
on
reaching
Tiphereth
<error>
and
once
more
on
his
attainment
to
Kether
<error>
which
then
Crowns
his
Work
<error>
Thus
the
First
Kether
Attainment
is
representative
of
the
Fifth
Visible
Progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
after
which
the
Aspirant
begins
to
contact
the
Sixth
progression
of
the
Whole
Tree
<error>
and
from
that
point
in
his
Career
<error>
every
further
progression
of
Malkuth
will
touch
the
center
of
a
Higher
Kether
<error>
to
Infinity
<error>
But
as
the
Sixth
visible
Progression
of
Malkuth
contacts
the
Second
visible
Kether
;
the
Seventh
<error>
the
Third
;
and
so
on
<error>
there
will
always
seem
to
be
Four
untraveled
Trees
between
<error>
It
may
be
that
these
represent
the
<error>
Four
Worlds
<error>
of
the
Qabalah
<error>
and
that
he
must
in
reality
always
progress
in
the
Four
Worlds
simultaneously
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
Path
of
Beth
<error>
or
Wisdom
<error>
leading
from
the
first
Malkuth
to
Hod
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
contains
<error>
essentially
<error>
all
the
Powers
of
Mercury
or
<error>
The
Magician
<error>
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
;
since
this
Path
leads
to
larger
and
larger
<error>
Hods
<error>
in
regular
sequence
<error>
Similarly
<error>
the
Path
of
Daleth
or
Love
<error>
<error>
The
Empress
<error>
<error>
or
Venus
<error>
leading
to
Netzach
<error>
continues
to
Infinity
in
that
direction
also
<error>
So
we
find
all
Love
and
Wisdom
concentrated
in
the
center
of
Malkuth
<error>
Since
all
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
<error>
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
interblend
on
the
Middle
Pillar
<error>
these
Powers
are
also
fully
concentrated
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
conversely
<error>
proceed
from
It
<error>
In
regard
to
the
other
Paths
and
Sephiroth
of
the
First
Tree
-
-
and
this
applies
equally
to
All
the
Trees
-
-
we
may
point
out
that
Netzach
and
Hod
will
always
be
found
in
the
exact
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chesed
and
Geburah
are
always
exactly
in
the
Centers
of
the
Paths
of
Cancer
<error>
<error>
The
Chariot
<error>
<error>
and
Luna
<error>
<error>
The
High
Priestess
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
larger
Tree
<error>
Chokmah
and
Binah
will
always
have
their
Centers
in
Leo
<error>
the
path
of
<error>
Strength
<error>
<error>
and
Gemini
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lovers
<error>
<error>
of
the
next
progressed
Tree
<error>
Kether
always
appears
in
the
Center
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
of
the
<error>
following
<error>
Yesod
<error>
to
infinity
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
the
Light
is
always
within
the
Life
of
the
Sun
<error>
and
the
Sun
within
the
Body
of
the
Moon
<error>
The
Reciprocal
Path
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
will
always
have
an
influence
horizontally
across
the
Abyss
of
the
next
Tree
below
<error>
The
path
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
will
always
leave
Him
suspended
from
the
Reciprocal
path
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
or
Aquarius
of
the
<error>
next
<error>
tree
<error>
while
he
is
seen
below
Tiphereth
on
his
own
Tree
<error>
This
is
exactly
where
he
is
mystically
<error>
supposed
<error>
to
<error>
be
<error>
according
to
the
old
system
of
the
paths
<error>
although
he
was
otherwise
<error>
assigned
<error>
<error>
It
is
a
matter
of
almost
unending
interest
to
trace
out
these
various
combinations
<error>
but
there
are
even
more
important
considerations
ahead
of
us
<error>
We
must
leave
the
Student
to
work
things
out
in
his
own
way
<error>
and
pass
on
to
wider
fields
of
study
<error>
Chapter
VI
During
the
afternoon
of
April
17
th
<error>
after
obtaining
a
glimpse
of
the
foregoing
possibilities
while
discussing
the
details
of
this
Plan
<error>
a
still
wider
conception
dawned
upon
me
<error>
Since
the
Center
of
Malkuth
has
become
the
Point
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
why
should
the
Tree
grow
only
in
one
Direction
<error>
What
we
have
been
calling
the
<error>
lower
<error>
part
of
the
Tree
is
in
the
form
of
an
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
and
the
Progression
of
the
Trees
only
increases
the
size
of
this
indefinitely
<error>
Surely
there
must
be
Six
such
Trees
<error>
forming
a
Star
<error>
and
so
filling
every
direction
of
two
-
dimensional
space
<error>
This
seemed
to
throw
light
on
some
little
understood
passages
of
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
which
I
shall
now
further
quote
<error>
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
words
we
studied
in
that
connection
were
<error>
<error>
These
Ten
Numbers
<error>
beyond
the
universal
One
<error>
have
the
boundless
realms
<error>
boundless
origin
and
end
<error>
<error>
but
the
verse
goes
on
<error>
<error>
an
abyss
of
good
and
one
of
evil
<error>
boundless
height
and
depth
<error>
East
and
West
<error>
North
and
South
<error>
and
the
one
only
God
and
King
<error>
faithful
for
ever
seated
on
his
throne
<error>
shall
rule
over
all
<error>
for
ever
and
ever
<error>
<error>
This
is
striking
evidence
that
our
Plan
is
that
which
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
the
Author
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
I
may
now
quote
the
remaining
verses
in
the
First
Chapter
<error>
since
these
make
the
matter
still
clearer
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
ineffable
<error>
whose
appearance
is
like
scintillating
flames
<error>
have
no
end
<error>
but
are
infinite
<error>
The
word
of
God
is
in
them
as
they
burst
forth
<error>
and
as
the
return
;
they
obey
the
divine
command
<error>
rushing
along
as
a
whirlwind
<error>
and
returning
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
throne
<error>
<error>
This
seems
fairly
understandable
in
the
Light
of
the
Two
Infinites
with
the
manifested
Universe
<error>
Ever
-
becoming
<error>
between
Them
<error>
<error>
These
ten
Sephiroth
which
are
<error>
moreover
<error>
ineffable
<error>
have
their
end
even
as
their
beginning
<error>
conjoined
<error>
even
as
is
a
flame
to
a
burning
coal
<error>
for
our
God
is
superlative
in
his
unity
<error>
and
does
not
permit
any
second
one
<error>
And
who
canst
thou
place
before
the
only
one
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
Nuit
<error>
Hadit
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
are
a
Perfect
Three
in
One
<error>
<error>
And
as
to
this
Decad
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
restrain
thy
lips
from
comment
<error>
and
thy
mind
from
thought
of
them
<error>
and
if
thy
heart
fail
thee
<error>
return
to
thy
place
;
therefore
is
it
written
<error>
The
living
creatures
ran
and
returned
<error>
<error>
and
on
this
wise
was
the
covenant
made
with
us
<error>
<error>
This
means
that
since
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
everywhere
the
same
in
every
part
of
space
<error>
once
its
general
attributions
are
fixed
in
the
mind
<error>
it
is
not
well
to
confuse
ourselves
by
too
much
attempt
at
progressed
expansion
of
the
idea
<error>
Rather
we
should
return
and
contemplate
the
Center
from
which
All
proceeds
<error>
thus
obtaining
the
Pure
Essence
Here
and
Now
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
emanations
of
number
<error>
One
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
blessed
and
more
than
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Living
God
of
the
Ages
<error>
The
Holy
Spirit
is
his
Voice
<error>
his
Spirit
<error>
and
his
Word
<error>
<error>
This
is
very
similar
to
the
instruction
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Be
thou
Hadit
my
secret
center
<error>
my
heart
and
my
tongue
<error>
<error>
but
CCXX
is
a
new
Covenant
<error>
and
goes
much
further
than
the
old
one
recorded
in
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
Second
<error>
from
the
Spirit
be
made
Air
and
formed
for
speech
<error>
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
three
of
which
are
mothers
<error>
A
<error>

<error>
Sh
;
seven
are
double

B
<error>
G
<error>

<error>

<error>

O

Tz
<error>
Q
;
but
the
spirit
is
first
among
these
<error>
Third
<error>
PRIMITIVE
WATER
HE
ALSO
FORMED
AND
DESIGNED
FROM
HIS
SPIRIT
<error>
and
from
the
void
and
formless
made
earth
even
as
a
rampart
<error>
or
the
standing
wall
<error>
and
VARIED
ITS
SURFACE
AS
THE
CROSSING
OF
BEAMS
<error>
Fourth
<error>
from
the
Water
<error>
He
designed
Fire
<error>
and
from
it
formed
to
himself
a
throne
of
honor
<error>
with
the
Auphanim
<error>
Seraphim
<error>
Holy
Animals
<error>
and
ministering
Angels
<error>
and
with
these
he
formed
his
dwelling
<error>
as
it
is
written
in
the
text
<error>
Who
makest
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flaming
fire
<error>
<error>
(
Psalm
104
<error>
v
<error>
4
)
<error>
Note
the
reference
to
the
design
made
from
Primitive
Water
by
the
Spirit
<error>
and
also
about
the
<error>
crossed
beams
<error>
or
Paths
of
the
Tree
<error>
His
thrones
of
Honor
<error>
are
the
Manifested
Kethers
<error>
Holy
animals
refer
to
the
Zodiac
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
He
selected
three
letters
from
the
simple
ones
<error>
and
sealed
them
as
forming
his
great
Name
IHV
and
he
sealed
the
universe
in
SIX
DIRECTIONS
<error>
<error>
Five
<error>
He
looked
above
<error>
and
sealed
the
height
<error>
with
IHV
<error>
<error>
Six
<error>
He
looked
below
and
sealed
the
deep
with
IVH
<error>
<error>
Seven
<error>
He
looked
forward
<error>
and
sealed
the
East
<error>
with
HIV
<error>
<error>
Eight
<error>
He
looked
backward
<error>
and
sealed
the
West
<error>
with
VHI
<error>
<error>
Nine
<error>
He
looked
to
the
right
<error>
and
sealed
the
South
<error>
with
VIH
<error>
<error>
Ten
<error>
He
looked
to
the
left
<error>
and
sealed
the
North
<error>
with
HVI
<error>
<error>
These
are
the
ten
ineffable
existences
<error>
the
Spirit
of
the
Living
God
<error>
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
Fire
<error>

North
and

<error>
<error>
So
ends
the
first
Chapter
of
this
mysterious
treatise
<error>
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
our
Six
-
fold
Star
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
has
puzzled
to
Qabalists
for
so
many
Centuries
<error>
With
its
Center
it
forms
the
Heptad
<error>
Let
us
now
examine
the
Design
of
this
wonderful
new
Star
<error>
as
drawn
in
such
minute
detail
<error>
(
See
Plate
B
<error>
)
A
glorious
vista
opens
before
us
-
-
Infinite
Space
in
the
Form
of
a
<error>
Pure
<error>
Snow
<error>
Flake
<error>
<error>
What
could
be
a
better
way
of
<error>
Fixing
the
Design
in
its
Purity
<error>
<error>
What
more
likely
<error>
since
all
things
are
said
to
have
proceeded
from
the
Primal
Water
under
the
action
of
Spirit
<error>
than
that
the
Substance
should
Crystallize
in
<error>
exactly
<error>
the
<error>
same
<error>
way
<error>
that
any
drop
of
water
<error>
or
any
crystal
<error>
is
found
to
take
form
under
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
polar
force
which
always
form
six
radiating
lines
or
axes
in
every
rain
drop
which
becomes
a
snow
-
flake
<error>
Surely
this
is
a
pure
enough
conception
of
the
beginning
of
all
things
and
the
infinite
progression
of
this
manifested
universe
<error>
Scientifically
it
can
hardly
be
denied
<error>
Thus
the
Pure
Essence
of
the
Soul
of
Man
may
also
crystallize
and
become
a
Center
of
the
Great
Star
<error>
This
may
take
place
at
any
point
in
space
and
at
any
moment
in
time
<error>
for
the
Center
of
the
Infinite
is
Everywhere
and
the
Circumference
Nowhere
<error>
What
a
vista
of
Attainment
opens
up
before
every
human
being
<error>
for
we
have
been
told
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
<error>
Every
man
and
every
woman
is
a
star
<error>
<error>
Also
<error>
Every
number
is
infinite
;
there
is
no
difference
<error>
<error>
But
let
us
consider
a
few
more
details
of
this
Divine
Plan
<error>
What
changes
have
really
occurred
owing
to
our
Multiplication
of
the
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
Netzach
and
Hod
and
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
-
-
which
before
were
seen
to
progress
directly
to
infinity
-
-
have
now
<error>
become
<error>
forever
<error>
united
<error>
<error>
There
is
no
difference
;
<error>
Love
<error>
is
<error>
ever
<error>
under
<error>
Will
<error>
<error>
Again
<error>
these
Combined
Paths
are
exactly
equal
to
the
Paths
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
which
formed
the
equilibrated
Middle
Pillar
<error>
for
the
Father
and
Mother
together
equal
the
Child
<error>
<error>
Every
<error>
Path
<error>
radiating
from
the
Center
is
now
Equilibrated
or
Balanced
<error>
The
combined
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
or
Venus
-
Mercury
is
always
to
be
found
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Binah
and
Chokmah
of
the
Two
Trees
of
the
Scale
below
<error>
Also
the
combined
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
always
lie
exactly
between
the
Spheres
of
Chesed
and
Geburah
<error>
or
Mercy
and
Severity
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
below
<error>
and
so
on
to
Infinity
<error>
All
else
remains
the
same
<error>
but
there
is
no
longer
any
possibility
of
unbalanced
progress
<error>
But
we
must
not
forget
the
instructions
in
Liber
Legis
<error>
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
<error>
<error>
The
Khabs
is
in
the
Khu
<error>
not
the
Khu
in
the
Khabs
<error>
Worship
then
the
Khabs
and
behold
my
light
shed
over
you
!
<error>
We
must
Worship
the
Central
Point
which
is
concealed
in
Malkuth
and
in
the
Center
of
our
Being
;
then
only
will
the
True
Light
of
Infinity
be
shed
upon
us
<error>
If
we
fail
in
this
<error>
seeking
in
the
outer
<error>
our
minds
fall
back
<error>
failing
to
grasp
that
which
is
beyond
our
finite
vision
<error>
<error>
The
Living
Creatures
run
and
return
<error>
and
having
returned
<error>
the
Illusions
of
Space
and
Time
are
exchanged
for
the
Everpresent
Here
and
Now
<error>
The
Introduction
to
this
treatise
should
now
be
more
clearly
understandable
to
the
average
reader
<error>
We
can
see
how
the
Light
or
Fruit
of
Light
<error>
the
Six
Kethers
<error>
are
always
First
in
Advance
towards
the
Infinite
without
<error>
Next
follows
the
progress
of
the
Life
or
Soul
of
Nature
and
of
Man
<error>
then
follows
the
regular
progression
of
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
in
ever
-
widening
Circles
as
<error>
Matter
<error>
eats
up
<error>
Form
<error>
and
the
<error>
Form
<error>
comprehends
the
Efficient
Cause
<error>
which
is
itself
the
manifestation
of
the
Invisible
Final
Cause
<error>
But
Malkuth
is
also
Nuit
<error>
for
<error>
Matter
<error>
or
<error>
Substance
<error>
is
continuous
<error>
so
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
she
contracts
upon
Hadit
the
Invisible
Center
<error>
or
that
He
Expands
towards
Her
Infinite
Girth
<error>
Ra
-
Hoor
-
Khuit
<error>
with
His
twin
Hoor
-
Pa
-
Kraat
hidden
within
Him
<error>
may
be
called
Heru
-
Ra
-
Ha
as
the
Crowned
Child
<error>
the
whole
Manifest
Universe
in
Time
and
Space
<error>
which
is
the
Star
418
<error>
This
<error>
too
<error>
is
the
Great
Hexagram
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
but
what
of
the
Pentagram
<error>
the
Microcosm
<error>
MAN
<error>
Another
great
Mystery
lies
before
us
<error>
needing
only
to
be
Brought
to
Light
<error>
as
will
be
shown
in
the
next
Chapter
<error>
Chapter
VII
We
have
seen
in
the
last
Chapter
how
our
original
conception
of
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
<error>
may
be
multiplied
and
crystallized
into
a
Macrocosmic
Snow
Flake
<error>
or
Six
-
fold
Star
<error>
Let
us
now
return
to
our
first
simple
form
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
and
examine
it
more
carefully
with
a
view
to
further
discoveries
<error>
We
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
this
as
representing
a
flat
two
-
dimensional
surface
<error>
but
we
were
not
necessarily
correct
in
our
supposition
<error>
In
reality
we
have
been
looking
at
the
front
surface
of
a
<error>
Triangular
<error>
<error>
Crystal
<error>
Prism
<error>
<error>
and
what
we
saw
was
not
all
in
one
plane
<error>
The
<error>
sides
<error>
of
the
Tree
are
but
two
angles
of
an
equilateral
solid
;
the
third
angle
<error>
at
the
back
<error>
is
invisible
<error>
being
completely
hidden
by
the
Paths
of
the
Central
Pillar
<error>
This
Central
Pillar
is
not
level
with
the
front
surface
<error>
but
is
the
<error>
Core
<error>
of
the
prism
<error>
Kether
is
the
Apex
of
a
pyramid
whose
base
is
equilateral
<error>
Malkuth
is
at
the
lower
point
of
a
descending
pyramid
<error>
all
four
sides
of
which
are
equilateral
<error>
thus
forming
a
Tetrahedron
<error>
Tiphereth
and
Yesod
are
both
embedded
in
the
solid
<error>
and
the
Paths
of
the
<error>
Three
Mothers
<error>
are
<error>
interior
<error>
channels
<error>
Looking
at
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
in
the
ordinary
manner
<error>
we
should
have
to
realize
that
only
the
Three
Reciprocal
Paths
<error>
and
the
Four
Paths
forming
the
Side
Pillars
<error>
are
actually
on
the
level
surface
before
us
<error>
There
are
<error>
however
<error>
three
Reciprocal
Paths
of
each
kind
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
nine
in
all
<error>
for
there
are
two
others
<error>
in
each
case
<error>
which
retreat
and
meet
at
the
third
angle
of
the
prism
<error>
There
is
another
pair
of
vertical
Paths
<error>
similar
to
those
at
the
sides
<error>
but
concealed
at
the
back
of
the
solid
<error>
Instead
of
there
being
only
two
Paths
from
Kether
to
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
there
are
<error>
three
<error>
<error>
one
sloping
away
to
the
concealed
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
triangular
surface
we
see
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
<error>
slopes
<error>
back
<error>
towards
Kether
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIII
here
]
The
Paths
from
Chokmah
and
Binah
to
Tiphereth
also
slope
inward
to
the
central
core
of
the
prism
<error>
and
there
is
a
third
Path
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
four
visible
Paths
from
Chesed
<error>
Geburah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
to
Tiphereth
are
likewise
sloping
within
the
solid
and
there
are
in
addition
two
invisible
Paths
at
the
back
<error>
The
Paths
from
Netzach
and
Hod
to
Yesod
also
incline
inward
<error>
since
Yesod
is
at
the
core
of
the
Tree
<error>
Again
there
is
another
similar
Path
concealed
<error>
which
slopes
down
from
the
angle
at
the
back
<error>
The
surface
of
the
Triangle
formed
by
the
Paths
connecting
Netzach
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Malkuth
<error>
is
not
vertical
<error>
but
falls
away
towards
the
back
<error>
and
there
are
two
similar
surfaces
connected
with
the
concealed
Sphere
of
Netzach
-
Hod
behind
the
solid
figure
<error>
This
at
first
may
seem
confusing
<error>
but
it
can
be
more
clearly
explained
by
means
of
diagrams
and
plates
<error>
Let
us
imagine
that
we
have
ascended
above
the
Tree
and
are
looking
directly
down
upon
Kether
<error>
From
this
position
we
should
perceive
a
triangular
figure
as
shown
in
the
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIV
here
]
The
nearest
point
to
us
will
be
Kether
and
the
other
three
Spheres
at
a
lower
level
<error>
The
three
triangular
surfaces
slope
away
from
Kether
to
the
Spheres
at
the
angles
<error>
But
what
are
these
Three
Spheres
and
Six
Paths
<error>
upon
which
we
have
been
looking
<error>
Our
conception
of
the
Tree
must
undergo
a
remarkable
change
<error>
The
three
bounding
Paths
are
all
equally
that
of
Tzaddi
<error>
Aquarius
<error>
or
<error>
The
Star
<error>
<error>
The
Three
Spheres
are
each
equally
both
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
The
Three
Paths
connecting
with
Kether
are
each
equally
Jupiter
and
Saturn
<error>
or
Kaph
and
Tau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Wheel
<error>
and
<error>
The
Universe
<error>
<error>
In
other
words
<error>
THERE
ARE
NO
LONGER
ANY
PAIRS
OF
OPPOSITES
<error>
and
there
never
were
in
reality
<error>
Each
idea
is
only
true
insofar
as
it
contains
its
own
opposite
<error>
So
the
Sphere
we
called
Chokmah
always
concealed
it
Binah
<error>
and
Binah
its
Chokmah
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
While
we
thought
the
Tree
represented
a
flat
surface
we
could
not
realize
how
these
apparently
opposite
Spheres
could
in
reality
be
one
and
the
same
<error>
but
now
that
we
have
discovered
the
Third
Angle
of
the
Prism
<error>
they
are
at
once
unified
without
difficulty
<error>
Also
the
former
Reciprocal
Paths
have
now
become
the
Boundaries
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
and
represent
a
sectional
plane
through
it
<error>
The
natures
of
the
opposite
Paths
are
also
unified
<error>
and
they
convey
the
Single
Influence
of
Kether
to
the
Dual
Spheres
they
connect
therewith
<error>
Let
us
now
include
Tiphereth
in
our
conception
<error>
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
we
are
looking
at
the
solid
from
the
front
<error>
but
that
it
has
been
twisted
round
slightly
<error>
so
as
to
make
the
concealed
angle
clearer
<error>
We
now
see
how
the
Paths
of
Resh
and
Ayin
or
<error>
The
Sun
<error>
and
<error>
The
Devil
<error>
<error>
are
<error>
triple
<error>
<error>
yet
<error>
one
<error>
<error>
These
conflicting
ideas
have
disappeared
in
a
harmonious
combination
<error>
The
Path
of
Shin
<error>
the
Holy
Spirit
<error>
at
the
core
of
the
Figure
uniting
Kether
and
Tiphereth
<error>
remains
single
<error>
What
were
the
Pillars
of
Mercy
and
Severity
<error>
are
now
no
longer
opposed
to
one
another
<error>
for
there
are
Three
Bounding
Pillars
<error>
as
well
as
the
Central
One
<error>
There
are
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
and
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
The
Paths
of
Samek
and
Pe
<error>
or
<error>
Temperance
<error>
and
<error>
The
Tower
<error>
<error>
are
now
united
<error>
as
are
those
of
Lamed
and
Yod
<error>
or
<error>
Justice
<error>
and
<error>
The
Hermit
<error>
<error>
If
we
were
next
to
take
a
section
through
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
at
the
line
formed
by
the
Path
of
Nun
<error>
or
<error>
Death
<error>
<error>
and
remove
the
upper
portion
<error>
while
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
upon
the
remainder
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvi
here
]
The
bounding
lines
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
would
be
the
Three
Paths
of
Nun
with
the
Three
Spheres
of
Chesed
-
Geburah
at
the
angles
<error>
Tiphereth
would
be
somewhat
lower
down
<error>
and
the
Three
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
<error>
or
Aries
-
Pisces
<error>
would
slope
towards
it
<error>
The
small
triangle
near
the
center
would
be
the
lower
part
of
the
three
paths
of
the
Resh
-
Ayin
triad
<error>
If
we
cut
through
the
prism
at
the
Path
of
Vau
<error>
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
while
still
<error>
looking
<error>
down
<error>
at
the
remainder
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxvii
here
]
Yesod
in
the
Center
<error>
somewhat
below
the
bounding
lines
and
Spheres
of
the
triple
paths
of
Vau
and
the
three
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
In
this
instance
there
would
be
no
small
triad
in
the
center
<error>
since
there
are
not
paths
equivalent
to
those
mentioned
in
regard
to
the
upper
section
<error>
But
if
from
this
position
we
looked
<error>
up
<error>
at
the
section
above
<error>
we
should
see
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxviii
here
]
The
same
Spheres
and
Paths
bounding
the
figure
<error>
but
Tiphereth
would
appear
in
the
center
<error>
connected
by
the
triple
paths
of
Teth
-
Zayin
<error>
or
<error>
The
Lion
-
Lovers
<error>
<error>
corresponding
to
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
Finally
<error>
should
we
look
up
at
the
whole
Tree
from
below
Malkuth
<error>
we
should
perceive
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXIX
here
]
Malkuth
in
the
Center
<error>
nearest
to
us
<error>
with
the
Triple
Path
<error>
or
Plane
<error>
of
the
<error>
Hierophant
<error>
some
distance
above
<error>
These
would
be
connected
by
the
triple
Paths
of
Beth
-
Daleth
<error>
Mercury
-
Venus
<error>
or
<error>
The
Magician
-
Empress
<error>
<error>
Thus
<error>
in
every
instance
<error>
would
the
<error>
pairs
of
opposites
<error>
be
truly
mated
and
resolved
into
a
unified
triplicity
<error>
in
three
dimensions
<error>
The
accompanying
Plate
shows
the
whole
<error>
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
with
its
13
Spheres
and
36
Paths
<error>
quite
clearly
<error>
The
whole
number
is
49
<error>
which
again
returns
to
Unity
as
13
<error>
49
also
represents
the
square
of
seven
<error>
and
the
Hebrew
Word
for
<error>
Solve
<error>
<error>
(
See

<error>
C
<error>
and
study
carefully
<error>
)
We
may
now
consider
approximately
what
would
be
the
impression
received
by
one
who
took
an
<error>
Astral
Journey
<error>
up
through
the
Central
Core
of
this
Triple
Tree
<error>
Starting
from
Malkuth
by
the
Path
of
Aleph
<error>
or
The
Fool
<error>
the
astral
form
would
travel
vertically
upwards
<error>
with
a
consciousness
of
being
surrounded
by
the
combined
influences
of
Mercury
-
Venus
perfectly
blended
<error>
while
the
surrounding
<error>
space
<error>
would
take
the
form
of
an
ever
-
increasing
triangle
<error>
till
Yesod
was
reached
<error>
At
this
juncture
he
would
feel
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
forces
from
the
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
(
<error>
The
Chariot
-
High
Priestess
<error>
or
Pure
Balanced
Aspiration
)
while
yet
his
consciousness
continued
to
expand
till
he
reached
the
full
limits
of
the
equilateral
triangle
bounded
by
the
paths
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
From
Yesod
onward
to
this
point
he
would
partake
of
the
Mystery
of
the
<error>
Hanged
Man
<error>
(
Primitive
Water
)
till
the
Influence
of
the
Hierophantic
Plane
began
to
initiate
him
into
its
deeper
Meanings
<error>
As
he
continued
by
this
Path
of
Mem
his
field
of
consciousness
would
remain
extended
to
its
limits
<error>
held
there
by
the
Forces
of
Yod
-
Lamed
or
<error>
The
Hermit
and
Justice
<error>
<error>
while
<error>
at
the
same
time
<error>
there
would
be
a
contraction
due
to
the
influence
of
the
Triple
Paths
of
Zayin
-
Teth
which
would
concentrate
his
Soul
in
Tiphereth
<error>
Rising
above
Tiphereth
his
Soul
would
expand
to
the
limits
of
his
field
of
consciousness
by
means
of
the
Paths
of
He
-
Qoph
(
or
Aries
-
Pisces
)
<error>
while
he
would
also
have
contacted
the
Influence
of
the
Holy
Spirit
in
the
Central
Path
of
Shin
<error>
This
would
expand
within
the
Soul
<error>
under
the
influence
of
the
triple
Paths
of
Ayin
-
Resh
(
or
Capricorn
-
Sol
)
<error>
Passing
through
the
Plane
of
<error>
Death
<error>
or
Scorpio
<error>
he
would
ascend
till
his
Spiritual
Consciousness
expanded
to
the
limits
of
his
Soul
Consciousness
<error>
which
would
have
been
affected
<error>
meanwhile
<error>
by
the
Paths
of
Pe
-
Samek
or
Mars
-
Sagittarius
(
<error>
The
Tower
-
Temperance
<error>
)
and
presently
he
would
reach
the
Plane
of
<error>
The
Star
<error>
(
Tzaddi
or
Aquarius
)
where
his
Soular
and
Spiritual
Fields
of
Consciousness
would
be
equally
extended
<error>
while
the
Spirit
would
steadily
Flame
in
the
Core
of
his
Being
<error>
Then
<error>
after
contacting
the
Triple
Influence
of
Chokmah
-
Binah
<error>
his
whole
Field
of
Consciousness
<error>
on
all
Planes
<error>
would
gradually
contract
along
the
Paths
of
Kaph
-
Tau
upon
Kether
<error>
upon
reaching
which
<error>
he
would
suddenly
find
Himself
once
more
in
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
the
Body
of
Nuit
<error>
concentrated
upon
the
Inner
Light
of
the
Khabs
<error>
the
only
veil
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Flame
in
every
Heart
of
Man
and
in
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
He
would
then
arise
as
a
truly
Enlightened
Being
<error>
clothed
in
a
body
of
Flesh
<error>
ready
to
go
forth
and
do
his
pleasure
among
the
living
<error>
As
it
is
written
in
the
Ritual
of
Mercury
<error>
<error>
I
travel
upon
high
<error>
I
tread
upon
the
Firmament
of
Nu
<error>
I
raise
a
flashing
-
flame
with
the
Lightning
of
Mine
Eye
;
ever
rushing
on
in
the
Splendor
of
the
daily
Glorified
Ra
;
giving
my
life
to
the
dwellers
of
Earth
<error>
<error>
Truly
will
he
have
learned
the
meaning
of
49
<error>
which
is
Solve

Chapter
VIII
Having
briefly
discussed
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
Prismatic
form
<error>
we
should
now
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
its
<error>
Multiplication
<error>
and
<error>
Projection
<error>
;
for
we
have
indeed
found
it
to
be
<error>
The
Stone
of
the
Wise
<error>
<error>
This
Crystal
Stone
is
capable
of
indefinite
increase
or
decrease
<error>
very
much
in
the
same
manner
as
was
found
possible
in
regard
to
the
flat
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
The
Center
of
Malkuth
will
once
more
be
our
starting
point
<error>
and
now
we
shall
find
the
smallest
Tree
will
be
within
the
next
larger
one
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
(
See
Plate
D
<error>
)
The
Central
Core
of
this
Prismatic
Tree
will
always
consist
of
Malkuth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Tiphereth
<error>
and
Kether
<error>
united
by
the
Three
Channels
of
Aleph
<error>
Mem
<error>
and
Shin
<error>
These
will
be
found
to
combine
and
recombine
as
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
progresses
in
size
<error>
The
Kether
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
always
be
embedded
in
the
Tiphereth
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
these
two
again
in
Yesod
of
the
next
<error>
The
triplication
of
the
Tree
makes
little
difference
to
these
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
but
we
shall
find
it
affects
some
of
the
others
<error>
The
Three
Netzach
-
Hods
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
appear
as
spheres
in
the
center
of
the
Three
Venus
-
Mercury
Paths
of
the
next
larger
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
indefinitely
<error>
The
Three
Chesed
-
Geburahs
of
the
smallest
Tree
will
form
similar
spheres
in
the
centers
of
the
Triple
Channels
of
Cancer
-
Luna
of
the
next
Tree
<error>
The
Three
Chokmah
-
Binahs
will
likewise
be
found
in
the
centers
of
the
Three
Channels
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
These
last
named
spheres
will
always
be
half
way
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
Sphere
of
Yesod
of
the
next
larger
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
The
Student
should
trace
out
these
correspondences
for
himself
<error>
making
a
careful
study
of
the
accompanying
Plate
D
<error>
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
complete
mental
picture
of
these
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
We
are
now
prepared
to
take
another
step
in
the
development
of
this
marvelous
Plan
<error>
but
first
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
contemplation
of
the
design
of
our
<error>
Crystalline
Snow
-
Flake
<error>
as
shown
in
Plate
B
<error>
In
dealing
with
the
two
-
dimensional
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
we
found
upon
combining
SIX
of
the
flat
<error>
Trees
<error>
we
obtained
a
Hexagonal
Figure
of
Sixfold
-
Star
<error>
This
symbolism
is
that
of
the
Macrocosm
<error>
What
will
be
the
result
of
our
combining
a
number
of
the
solid
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
Upon
experiment
we
find
in
this
instance
that
they
do
not
combine
in
six
-
fold
arrangement
as
before
<error>
but
that
FIVE
such
Prisms
taken
together
form
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
the
center
of
which
is
Malkuth
and
the
bounding
lines
all
representing
the
Paths
of
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
<error>
The
lines
connecting
the
Spheres
at
the
five
angles
<error>
which
are
all
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
will
each
be
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Of
course
<error>
looking
at
the
solid
figure
from
this
angle
<error>
Malkuth
is
nearer
to
us
than
the
Netzach
-
Hod
Spheres
<error>
for
the
latter
are
connected
by
the
retreating
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
In
addition
to
this
Pentagon
we
should
also
see
something
of
the
remainder
of
the
five
solid
Trees
<error>
in
perspective
<error>
as
they
spread
out
behind
or
away
from
us
<error>
The
Great
Work
<error>
as
symbolized
in
the
Word
of
the
Aeon
<error>
ABRAHADABRA
<error>
has
always
consisted
in
finding
the
equivalence
between
the
Microcosm
and
the
Macrocosm
<error>
or
the
formula
5
=
6
<error>
Here
we
find
a
higher
aspect
of
the
Work
<error>
for
this
solid
Figure
is
built
up
on
purely
Microcosmic
Lines
of
Five
Solids
to
a
section
<error>
But
we
have
now
discovered
a
<error>
Rose
<error>
capable
of
extension
in
Five
Directions
to
Infinity
<error>
and
containing
within
itself
all
the
Correspondences
<error>
with
powers
of
indefinite
multiplication
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
not
capable
of
filling
the
whole
of
Space
<error>
but
when
we
take
FOUR
such
sections
and
combine
them
<error>
we
are
able
to
make
the
Complete
Three
Dimensional
Solid
<error>
which
will
extend
in
every
direction
as
the
Trees
Progress
in
Size
<error>
thus
completely
filling
all
known
space
<error>
Such
a
figure
is
composed
of
Twenty
of
our
original
Prismatic
Trees
<error>
and
20
is
the
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
basic
letter
of
the
Hebrew
Alphabet
<error>
and
the
First
Letter
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
It
is
also
the
Numeration
of
the
Letter
Kaph
<error>
which
corresponds
to
<error>
The
Wheel
of
Life
<error>
and
the
Father
IU
-
Pater
<error>
When
these
are
so
combined
<error>
the
central
Point
of
Malkuth
is
completely
embedded
in
the
Center
of
the
Figure
(
unless
it
be
built
of
actual
Crystals
<error>
in
which
case
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
)
<error>
The
accompanying
plate
showing
the
<error>
Projection
<error>
of
the
Stone
<error>
will
make
the
matter
clear
to
the
Student
<error>
and
open
up
a
wonderful
vista
to
his
mind
<error>
We
have
now
a
figure
capable
of
progression
in
twenty
directions
<error>
The
true
Kether
is
concealed
within
the
Malkuth
at
the
Center
<error>
and
this
expands
spherically
as
the
size
of
the
solid
increases
<error>
We
have
20
Projecting
Kethers
representing
the
Forerunners
of
Light
<error>
followed
by
60
Chokmah
-
Binahs
and
60
Chesed
-
Geburahs
<error>
Then
follow
20
Tiphereths
concealed
in
the
cores
of
the
Prisms
and
representing
the
Substance
of
the
Light
which
is
the
Soul
or
Life
<error>
We
are
able
to
perceive
only
12
Netzach
-
Hods
<error>
for
these
have
now
united
into
groups
of
five
dual
spheres
in
one
<error>
Within
the
cores
of
the
prisms
<error>
next
follow
20
Yesods
<error>
while
a
single
Malkuth
is
at
the
Central
Point
of
All
<error>
We
have
<error>
therefore
<error>
One
Hundred
and
Ninety
-
Three
Spheres
in
all
<error>
connected
with
the
un
-
progressed
figure
<error>
and
this
number
reduces
to
Thirteen
<error>
which
is
Unity
<error>
193
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
also
a
prime
number
<error>
There
are
60
Paths
equivalent
to
Iu
-
Pater
-
Saturn
;
60
which
correspond
to
Aquarius
;
60
to
Sagittarius
-
Mars
;
60
to
Scorpio
;
and
60
to
Virgo
-
Libra
<error>
But
there
are
only
30
representing
Taurus
or
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
since
these
have
now
combined
in
pairs
<error>
Thus
we
have
330
Visible
Paths
<error>
There
are
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Air
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Water
<error>
20
Invisible
Paths
of
Fire
or
Spirit
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Sol
-
Capricorn
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Leo
-
Gemini
<error>
60
Invisible
Paths
of
Cancer
-
Luna
<error>
But
only
12
Invisible
Paths
of
Venus
-
Mercury
<error>
Thus
we
have
252
Invisible
Paths
in
all
<error>
The
Paths
of
the
Tree
were
always
attributed
to
The
Serpent
;
it
is
strange
that
these
invisible
Paths
should
be
252
<error>
which
is
the
numeration
of
the
Hebrew
word
MAVRH
<error>
meaning
<error>
The
Serpent
<error>
s
Den
<error>
<error>
The
Total
number
of
Paths
in
the
complete
figure
is
thus
330
plus
252
which
is
582
<error>
330
<error>
the
number
of
visible
Paths
is
equivalent
to
the
Hebrew
word
MTzR
meaning
<error>
Boundary
<error>
Terminus
<error>
or
Crosspath
<error>
582
reduces
to
15
<error>
the
numeration
of
IH
that
Father
and
Mother
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
or
if
further
reduced
we
get
6
<error>
which
is
equivalent
to
V
<error>
the
Son
<error>
IHV
<error>
it
will
be
remembered
<error>
represent
the
three
simple
letters
which
<error>
according
to
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
were
chosen
by
God
as
His
Name
in
the
Six
Directions
<error>
The
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
is
193
plus
582
=
775
<error>
This
reduces
to
10
<error>
and
therefore
to
Unity
<error>
But
the
Points
of
the
20
Kethers
are
so
arranged
as
to
form
when
connected
<error>
TWELVE
perfectly
regular
Pentagons
<error>
Thus
the
whole
structure
indicates
a
perfect
DODECAHEDRON
and
<error>
when
enclosed
in
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
touches
it
a
eighty
points
<error>
The
whole
solid
may
be
considered
as
capable
of
expansion
by
means
of
the
progression
of
the
unit
<error>
Trees
<error>
as
explained
before
<error>
Likewise
<error>
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
reduction
or
contraction
of
the
whole
figure
upon
the
Infinitely
Small
<error>
(
See
Plate
E
<error>
)
We
have
therefore
discovered
in
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
<error>
properly
Multiplied
and
Projected
according
to
the
Art
of
the
Wise
<error>
what
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
or
the
natural
structure
of
Matter
under
the
Influence
of
the
Concealed
Spirit
<error>
Thus
the
<error>
Unknown
Warrior
<error>
who
made
some
such
assertion
in
the
presence
of
Frater
Perdurabo
<error>
and
earned
such
scant
praise
<error>
may
have
been
inspired
to
a
degree
he
<error>
himself
<error>
little
realized
<error>
The
following
quotation
from
<error>
The
Two
Creation
Stories
<error>
by
James
S
<error>
Forrester
-
Brown
throws
valuable
light
upon
the
conception
of
the
Tree
of
Life
as
the
Anatomy
of
the
Body
of
God
<error>
<error>
When
the
Divine
Will
is
born
in
the
heart
of
a
human
soul
<error>
true
free
-
will
begins
<error>
for
will
is
only
free
when
in
accord
with
the
Great
Will
<error>
Knowledge
follows
<error>
and
life
becomes
full
of
meaning
and
purposeful
activity
<error>
The
drama
of
the
formal
life
(
the
tree
of
knowledge
)
develops
in
terms
of
the
Higher
Will
(
the
tree
of
life
)
<error>
so
that
daily
happenings
appear
to
lift
the
veil
from
universal
truths
<error>
illuminating
the
life
<error>
When
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
tree
of
life
<error>
reason
and
intuition
<error>
the
personal
and
the
universal
<error>
are
harmoniously
united
in
the
individualized
soul
<error>
the
daily
life
becomes
the
moving
image
and
expression
of
the
living
Soul
of
the
universe
<error>
<error>
We
may
think
of
the
tree
of
life
as
the
arteries
of
the
Great
Cosmic
Body
<error>
Through
these
arteries
<error>
as
along
channels
<error>
the
cosmic
Life
pulses
forth
with
every
heart
beat
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
This
is
a
very
deep
mystery
<error>
Until
this
Life
is
caught
up
by
each
individualized
soul
and
returns
through
himself
to
the
Great
Cosmic
Person
<error>
flowing
back
along
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
<error>
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
power
within
the
separated
soul
affecting
the
Great
Person
<error>
Moreover
<error>
unless
a
counter
-
current
is
set
up
<error>
the
Life
flows
past
the
soul
<error>
and
this
does
not
truly
live
<error>
The
individualized
soul
requires
to
fashion
capillaries
throughout
his
nature
and
keep
them
in
use
<error>
to
allow
of
the
return
flow
through
them
into
the
cosmic
veins
<error>
That
this
shall
be
established
he
must
<error>
greatly
daring
<error>
yet
with
awe
and
humility
<error>
seek
to
know
the
nature
of
God
and
of
man
and
the
relation
between
them
<error>
When
he
is
able
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
is
<error>
he
realizes
with
a
sense
of
abasement
the
imperfections
and
impurities
of
his
complex
personality
<error>
and
the
immediate
necessity
to
turn
from
death
unto
Life
<error>
This
does
no
imply
a
purely
temporary
repentance
<error>
but
a
Great
Act
of
turning
back
<error>
which
cleanses
the
entire
life
of
the
soul
and
establishes
organized
relations
with
the
Cosmic
Person
<error>
making
it
possible
for
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
to
be
born
<error>
from
Above
<error>
within
the
soul
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
knowledge
is
then
seen
as
the
veins
of
the
Great
Body
along
which
flow
back
the
counter
-
currents
carrying
the
fruitage
of
the
time
-
order
<error>
and
thus
the
tree
of
life
<error>
with
its
arteries
along
which
cosmic
life
is
<error>
timelessly
<error>
propelled
from
the
Great
Heart
<error>
is
complemented
<error>
The
two
trees
<error>
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
<error>
become
united
within
the
Cosmic
Heart
and
Body
<error>
the
<error>
Eden
<error>
of
the
Great
Person
<error>
and
the
<error>
Christ
<error>
consciousness
is
complete
<error>
<error>
The
tree
of
life
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
tree
of
universal
life
growing
round
and
encompassing
the
individual
soul
<error>
When
that
tree
is
truly
one
with
the
tree
of
phenomenal
self
<error>
the
tree
of
knowledge
<error>
then
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
<error>
the
ideal
and
the
actual
are
one
<error>
and
their
fruits
are
the
living
powers
<error>
From
this
universal
-
personal
tree
spring
all
the
virtues
<error>
and
on
it
they
blossom
and
ripen
<error>
They
are
the
fruits
of
temporal
experience
<error>
containing
the
seeds
of
eternal
Life
<error>
and
<error>
as
such
<error>
correspond
to
the
disciples
of
one
<error>
s
own
<error>
Christ
within
<error>
at
the
final
Consummation
<error>
<error>
In
the
Apocryphal
literature
<error>
Michael
<error>
Archangel
of
the
Sun
<error>
is
set
over
the
tree
which
<error>
at
the
time
of
the
great
judgment
(
note
the
position
of
<error>
The
Judgment
<error>
as
Shin
on
the
Tree
<error>
Achad
<error>
)
<error>
is
given
over
to
the
righteous
<error>
who
obtain
Life
from
its
fruit
<error>
This
is
the
tree
of
universal
life
<error>
now
one
with
the
personal
tree
in
the
region
of
material
existence

Let
us
now
make
a
brief
resume
of
our
work
<error>
so
as
to
keep
in
mind
a
clear
conception
of
the
various
stages
through
which
it
has
passed
;
but
in
order
to
show
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
the
solution
of
the
Mysteries
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
we
may
look
back
a
few
years
in
order
to
see
more
clearly
the
results
of
the
influence
of
the
New
Aeon
and
the
rapid
strides
which
have
been
made
since
its
incoming
in
the
year
1904
E
<error>
V
<error>
In
the
year
1886
<error>
which
happens
to
be
that
of
the
birth
of
the
present
writer
<error>
Dr
<error>
W
<error>
Wynn
Westcott
<error>
Hon
<error>
Magus
of
the
Soc
<error>
Ros
<error>
in
Ang
<error>
<error>
translated
the
ancient
treatise
known
as
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
into
English
<error>
and
read
the
results
of
his
pioneer
work
before
the
Hermetic
Society
in
London
<error>
In
1887
his
work
was
published
in

11
of
Chapter
I
<error>
which
have
been
quoted
in
full
in
Chapter
VI
of
the
present
treatise
and
which
described
how
IHV
looked
above
and
sealed
its
height
<error>
below
and
sealed
its
depth
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
Dr
<error>
Westcott
gives
the
following
diagrams
together
with
the
words
<error>
<error>
Note
the
description
of
the
Decad
<error>
First
a
tetrad
is
formed
<error>
then
a
hexad
<error>
<error>
And
that
was
all
the
explanation
which
seemed
necessary
<error>
or
was
forthcoming
<error>
at
the
time
<error>
Not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
<error>
but
<error>
as
stated
above
<error>
in
order
to
show
the
real
progress
which
has
been
made
<error>
we
should
compare
the
simple
diagram
of
the
<error>
hexad
<error>
with
Plate
B
of
the
present
work
<error>
and
we
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
signs
of
genuine
advance
in
Qabalistic
thought
during
the
last
37
years
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIII
here
]
But
the
ancient
Sepher
Yetzirah
itself
<error>
although
giving
a
possible
indication
of
this
six
-
fold
development
as
being
present
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
<error>
or
compiler
<error>
in
the
distant
past
<error>
contains
little
that
could
be
construed
as
an
indication
of
the
further
development
of
the
Idea
in
three
-
dimensional
form
as
suggested
by
the
present
author

There
is
a
verse
in
Chapter
II
which
reads
<error>
<error>
These
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
the
foundations
<error>
He
arranged
as
on
a
sphere
<error>
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
one
modes
of
entrance
<error>
If
the
sphere
be
rotated
forwards
<error>
good
is
implied
<error>
if
in
a
retrograde
manner
<error>
evil
is
intended
<error>
<error>
but
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
thought
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
Dodecahedron
and
its
infinite
progression
or
expansion
<error>
Rather
we
are
inclined
to
think
we
have
taken
a
step
not
previously
written
of
<error>
or
contemplated
in
any
of
the
old
treatises
on
the
subject
<error>
In
May
of
last
year
(
1922
E
<error>
V
<error>
)
<error>
as
the
result
of
a
series
of
Initiations
of
a
very
direct
nature
<error>
dating
particularly
from
June
21
st
<error>
1916
<error>
and
developing
on
different
Planes
<error>
December
21
st
<error>
1917
<error>
September
to
October
<error>
1918
<error>
April
1921
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
the
present
writer
obtained
a
clue
to
a
new
intellectual
conception
of
the
Qabalistic
Plan
<error>
It
seemed
that
although
the
10
Sephiroth
were
in
proper
order
and
arrangement
<error>
the
<error>
Paths
<error>
could
be
changed
to
great
advantage
<error>
and
this
resulted
in
the
publication
of
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
or
The
Bride
<error>
s
Reception
<error>
which
was
an
attempt
to
show
clearly
the
old
methods
<error>
and
contained
the
new
ideas
in
the
form
of
an
Appendix
<error>
Meanwhile
<error>
in
April
of
this
year
<error>
he
was
led
to
discover
a
much
more
harmonious
explanation
of
the
Keys
of
the
Tarot
when
they
were
arranged
on
the
Tree
according
to
the
Revised
Order
of
the
Paths
<error>
The
results
of
this
investigation
have
been
recorded
in
<error>
The
Egyptian
Revival
<error>
<error>
to
which
I
must
refer
the
reader
<error>
I
may
say
that
this
book
seems
an
indication
of
the
revival
of
the
lost
Universal
Tradition
of
the
Golden
Age
and
explains
the
nature
of
the
present
Egyptian
Revival
in
a
reasonable
manner
<error>
This
work
led
on
to
the
discoveries
recorded
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
which
may
be
briefly
summed
up
as
follows
<error>
The
Tree
of
Life
in
its
regular
and
simple
form
has
been
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
work
<error>
but
the
revised
order
of
the
Paths
adopted
<error>
as
the
one
which
seems
most
reasonable
<error>
It
became
apparent
that
the
due
proportions
of
the
parts
of
the
Tree
had
not
previously
been
taken
into
serious
consideration
as
of
vital
importance
to
the
study
of
the
matter
<error>
Examples
of
the
designs
of
<error>
Trees
<error>
in
well
known
works
on
the
subject
<error>
show
great
variation
in
this
respect
<error>
We
discovered
that
the
basis
of
the
Tree
was
the
Equilateral
Triangle
<error>
the
Vesica
Piscis
and
the
rectangle
formed
on
its
length
and
breadth
<error>
These
were
shown
to
have
marvelous
properties
which
have
been
sufficient
to
interest
and
impress
some
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
men
of
past
history
<error>
and
upon
which
the
style
of
Gothic
Architecture
is
wholly
based
<error>
But
the
fact
that
the
Qabalistic
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
in
its
entirety
partook
of
these
same
marvelous
properties
<error>
came
to
use
as
a
new
revelation
<error>
We
found
that
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
was
not
fixed
<error>
but
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
or
contraction
<error>
so
that
it
truly
lived
<error>
and
that
all
our
<error>
Ideas
<error>
and
<error>
Correspondences
<error>
based
thereon
<error>
were
similarly
capable
of
indefinite
progress
<error>
thus
enabling
the
mind
of
man
to
expand
or
contract
at
will
<error>
without
interfering
with
its
balanced
and
equilibrated
arrangement
once
the
Plan
of
the
Tree
had
become
firmly
rooted
therein
<error>
We
then
discovered
that
<error>
as
indicated
in
the
<error>
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
<error>
this
plan
could
be
multiplied
when
arranged
as
an
ever
-
increasing
Hexagon
<error>
based
upon
the
progression
of
SIX
TREES
reflected
in
the
Height
<error>
Depth
<error>
North
<error>
South
<error>
East
<error>
and
West
<error>
This
we
found
to
be
the
design
of
the
naturally
crystallized
snowflake
<error>
and
it
gave
us
the
means
of
filling
all
two
-
dimensional
Space
<error>
We
further
discovered
that
the
Original
Tree
might
be
considered
as
a
Prismatic
Solid
in
Three
Dimensions
and
that
FIVE
such
prisms
formed
a
perfect
pentagonal
figure
when
united
<error>
In
other
words
the
means
of
changing
the
Hexagram
into
the
Pentagram
is
through
a
transition
from
2
to
3
dimensions
<error>
as
can
be
simply
shown
if
we
take
a
piece
of
paper
<error>
cut
into
a
perfect
Hexagon
<error>
or
Hexagram
<error>
and
then
make
another
cut
from
one
point
to
the
center
<error>
as
in
the
following
diagram
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxiv
here
]
We
shall
find
that
this
piece
of
paper
will
fold
into
a
perfect
Pentagon
or
Pentagram
if
we
slide
one
half
of
the
divided
point
<error>
A
<error>
under
the
figure
till
it
coincides
with
<error>
B
<error>
<error>
thus
raising
the
center
of
the
figure
into
the
third
dimension
<error>
Four
of
these
blocks
of
Five
Trees
were
found
to
form
a
solid
capable
of
progression
in
all
directions
so
as
to
fill
every
dimension
of
known
space
<error>
and
the
nature
of
the
whole
figure
was
found
to
be
that
of
a
perfect
Dodecahedron
or
Twelve
-
fold
figure
<error>
each
side
of
which
is
a
perfect
Pentagon
<error>
Perhaps
this
represents
the
Tree
in
the
Midst
of
the
Garden
having
Twelve
manner
of
Fruits
<error>
Each
of
the
surfaces
being
Pentagonal
<error>
represents
a
Microcosm
or
Type
of
Man
and
may
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
Twelve
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
Twelve
Tribes
<error>
Apostles
<error>
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
<error>
etc
<error>
At
the
Center
of
All
is
Malkuth
<error>
so
that
this
is
indeed
the
<error>
Closed
Palace
of
the
Bride
<error>
<error>
the
secrets
of
which
were
promised
as
a
reward
to
those
who
succeeded
in
interpreting
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
This
Prismatic
and
Crystalline
conception
of
the
<error>
Tree
<error>
is
perhaps
the
reward
mentioned
in
Liber
Legis
of
those
who
have
passed
the
<error>
Third
Ordeal
<error>
<error>
Chapter
III
states
<error>
<error>
63
<error>
The
fool
readeth
this
Book
of
the
Law
and
its
comment
<error>
and
he
understandeth
it
not
<error>
<error>
64
<error>
Let
him
come
through
the
first
ordeal
<error>
and
it
will
be
to
him
as
silver
<error>
<error>
65
<error>
Through
the
second
<error>
gold
<error>
<error>
66
<error>
Through
the
third
<error>
stones
of
precious
water
<error>
<error>
67
<error>
Through
the
fourth
<error>
ultimate
sparks
of
the
infinite
fire
<error>
<error>
68
<error>
Yet
to
all
it
shall
seem
beautiful
<error>
Its
enemies
who
say
not
so
<error>
are
mere
liars
<error>
<error>
69
<error>
There
is
success
<error>
<error>
But
what
of
the
ultimate
sparks
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
Who
knows
!
There
may
be
yet
some
further
revelation
before
all
is
accomplished
<error>
But
to
my
mind
this
refers
to
the
Mystery
of
Hadit
<error>
the
Concealed
Center
<error>
the
Lost
Father
<error>
Who
is
the
Core
of
every
Star
<error>
and
the
Flame
that
burn
in
every
heart
of
man
<error>
For
<error>
since
the
Universe
is
the
Child
of
the
Two
Infinites
<error>
every
point
in
space
is
equally
the
Center
of
the
Whole
<error>
and
the
Spirit
of
God
is
in
each
of
us
<error>
as
an
ultimate
spark
of
the
intimate
fire
<error>
But
<error>
in
any
case
<error>
we
have
progressed
<error>
and
we
have
discovered
a
strange
new
interpretation
of
the
prophetic
words
of
<error>
Liber
A
<error>
Ash
<error>
<error>
which
states
<error>
<error>
This
chain
reaches
from
Eternity
to
Eternity
<error>
ever
in
triangles
-
-
is
not
my
symbol
a
triangle
<error>
-
-
ever
in
circles
-
-
is
not
the
symbol
of
the
Beloved
a
circle
<error>
Therein
is
all
progress
base
illusion
<error>
for
every
circle
is
alike
and
every
triangle
alike
!
<error>
But
the
progress
is
progress
<error>
and
progress
is
rapture
<error>
constant
<error>
dazzling
showers
of
light
<error>
waves
of
dew
<error>
flames
of
the
hair
of
the
Great
Goddess
<error>
flowers
of
the
roses
that
are
about
her
neck
<error>
Amen
!
<error>
Chapter
X
After
this
brief
resume
we
may
once
again
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
main
results
of
our
researches
as
summed
up
on
the
Dodecahedron
within
the
perfect
Sphere
<error>
It
would
almost
seem
that
our
original
Qabalistic
conceptions
have
led
us
out
of
the
realm
of
thought
usually
linked
with
the
Hebrew
Qabalah
into
an
atmosphere
of
Intelligibles
which
is
associated
with
the
philosophy
of
the
Masters
in
ancient
Greece
<error>
Or
<error>
we
may
say
<error>
as
our
conceptions
have
expanded
towards
the
Universal
<error>
we
have
contacted
another
set
of
teachings
<error>
thus
uniting
Hebrew
and
Greek
thought
<error>
Plato
informs
us
in
his
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
<error>
Geometry
rightly
treated
is
the
knowledge
of
the
Eternal
<error>
<error>
and
he
is
reported
by
Plutarch
to
have
said
that
<error>
God
is
always
geometrizing
<error>
<error>
Nor
was
the
conception
of
the
Universe
in
the
form
of
the
Dodecahedron
unknown
to
Plato
<error>
for
in
his
<error>
Timaeus
<error>
this
idea
is
clearly
indicated
<error>
But
just
how
this
solid
figure
was
built
up
so
as
to
symbolize
the
Universe
in
all
its
details
<error>
if
known
to
the
ancients
<error>
was
not
revealed
<error>
Let
us
see
<error>
however
<error>
what
hints
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
other
authorities
<error>
Proclus
<error>
in
his
Introduction
to
Books
II
and
III
of
Plato
<error>
s
<error>
Republic
<error>
<error>
says
<error>
<error>
But
the
former
(
Vulcan
)
artificially
fabricated
the
whole
sensible
order
<error>
and
filling
it
with
physical
reasons
and
powers
<error>
He
also
fashioned
<error>
twenty
<error>
tripods
<error>
about
the
heavens
<error>
that
he
may
adorn
them
with
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
sided
figures
and
fabricates
various
and
many
-
formed
sublunary
species
<error>
<error>
To
which
Thomas
Taylor
<error>
the
great
Cambridge
Platonist
<error>
adds
<error>
<error>
Viz
<error>
<error>
the
dodecahedron
<error>
which
is
bounded
by
twelve
equal
and
equilateral
pentagons
<error>
and
consists
of
twenty
solid
angles
<error>
of
which
the
tripods
of
Vulcan
are
images
;
for
every
angle
of
the
dodecahedron
is
formed
from
the
junction
of
three
lines
<error>
<error>
There
are
several
references
to
the
dodecahedron
in
Madam
Blavatsky
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
<error>
Doctrine
<error>
<error>
among
which
the
following
is
of
special
interest
<error>
<error>
The
most
distinct
and
the
one
prevailing
idea
<error>
found
in
all
ancient
teaching
<error>
with
reference
to
Cosmic
Evolution
and
the
first
<error>
creation
<error>
of
our
Globe
with
all
its
products
<error>
organic
and
inorganic
-
-
strange
word
for
an
Occultist
to
use
!
-
-
is
that
the
whole
Kosmos
has
sprung
from
the
Divine
Thought
<error>
This
Thought
impregnates
Matter
<error>
which
is
co
-
eternal
with
the
One
Reality
;
and
all
that
lives
and
breathes
evolves
from
the
Emanations
of
the
One
Immutable
Parabrahman
-
Mulaprakriti
<error>
the
Eternal
One
-
Root
<error>
The
former
of
these
<error>
in
its
aspect
of
the
Central
Point
turned
inward
<error>
so
to
say
<error>
into
regions
quite
inaccessible
to
human
intellect
is
Absolute
Abstraction
;
whereas
<error>
in
its
aspect
as
Mulaprakriti
the
Eternal
Root
of
All
<error>
it
gives
one
at
least
some
hazy
comprehension
of
the
Mystery
of
Being
<error>
<error>
Therefore
<error>
it
was
taught
in
the
inner
temples
that
the
visible
Universe
of
Spirit
and
Matter
is
but
the
Concrete
Image
of
the
Ideal
Abstraction
;
it
was
built
on
the
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
Thus
<error>
our
Universe
existed
from
eternity
in
a
latent
state
<error>
The
Soul
animating
this
purely
Spiritual
Universe
is
the
Central
Sun
<error>
the
highest
Deity
Itself
<error>
It
was
not
the
One
who
built
the
concrete
form
of
the
idea
<error>
but
the
First
Begotten
;
and
<error>
as
it
was
constructed
on
the
geometrical
figure
of
the
dodecahedron
the
First
Begotten
<error>
was
pleased
to
employ
12
<error>
000
years
in
its
creation
<error>
<error>
<error>
It
would
seem
<error>
from
the
above
<error>
that
the
<error>
Model
of
the
First
Divine
Idea
<error>
may
have
been
very
much
in
harmony
with
the
ideal
Formative
Principle
we
have
been
studying
<error>
This
conception
of
the
Universe
as
a
Dodecahedron
appears
if
not
to
have
originated
with
Plato
<error>
to
have
first
been
mentioned
by
him
in
his
writings
<error>
All
the
references
I
have
so
far
discovered
in
connection
with
the
idea
<error>
can
be
traced
back
to
this
source
<error>
Mr
<error>
Harley
Burr
Alexander
<error>
of
the
University
of
Nebraska
<error>
makes
some
interesting
remarks
in
this
connection
(
Nature
and
Human
Nature
<error>
P
<error>
378
)
<error>
<error>
<error>
We
must
conceive
<error>
<error>
says
Plato
<error>
<error>
of
three
natures
<error>
first
<error>
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
<error>
and
this
would
be
the
world
of
nature
as
we
experience
it
;
second
<error>
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
<error>
and
this
is
the
recipient
or
matrix
of
nature
;
and
third
<error>
that
of
which
the
generated
world
is
an
image
<error>
and
this
is
the
cosmic
reason
or
form
<error>
We
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
<error>
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
<error>
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
we
think
immediately
of
the
mythopoetic
union
of
Earth
and
Heaven
and
the
Life
of
Nature
which
is
its
offspring
<error>
But
for
Plato
this
is
a
mere
trope
;
he
does
not
rest
without
being
scientifically
explicit
<error>
<error>
There
are
three
kinds
of
being
<error>
that
which
is
uncreated
and
indestructible
<error>
changeless
<error>
eternal
<error>
imperceptible
to
any
sense
<error>
open
only
to
the
contemplation
of
the
intelligence
<error>
and
this
is
the
principle
of
the
Father
<error>
the
ideal
or
formal
essence
of
the
world
;
again
<error>
that
which
is
sensible
and
created
and
always
in
motion
<error>
the
Child
<error>
the
world
of
change
and
life
;
and
finally
<error>
there
is
a
third
nature
<error>
the
Mother
<error>
which
<error>
like
the
Father
<error>
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
<error>
which
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
<error>
and
is
apprehended
<error>
without
the
help
of
sense
<error>
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
<error>
and
is
indeed
hardly
real
<error>
<error>
This
nature
is
space
<error>
and
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
<error>
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
<error>
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
<error>
<error>
This
mothering
space
which
is
hardly
real
<error>
yet
is
the
cause
of
the
determinism
of
nature
<error>
Plato
identifies
as
the
material
element
of
being
<error>
As
pure
matter
<error>
it
is
purely
indeterminate
<error>
but
it
is
receptive
of
all
determinations
<error>
The
four
elements
<error>
earth
<error>
air
<error>
fire
and
water
<error>
are
formed
from
it
<error>
for
<error>
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
<error>
insofar
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
<error>
<error>
Plato
<error>
s
conception
of
the
formation
of
these
elements
from
the
original
substance
was
as
purely
mathematical
as
are
our
modern
physical
notions
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
he
says
<error>
and
the
forms
which
he
assigned
were
the
forms
of
the
regular
solids
<error>
Thus
the
form
of
the
fiery
element
is
the
pyramid
<error>
of
air
<error>
the
octahedron
;
of
water
<error>
the
icosahedron
;
of
earth
<error>
the
cube
<error>
The
fifth
solid
<error>
the
<error>
Dodecahedron
<error>
<error>
is
the
form
of
the
universe
as
a
whole
<error>
or
perhaps
one
might
say
the
<error>
scaffold
upon
which
the
spherical
universe
is
constructed
<error>
<error>
Further
<error>
these
elements
are
themselves
compounded
of
simpler
mathematical
forms
<error>
the
pyramid
<error>
octahedron
and
icosahedron
of
equilateral
<error>
the
cube
of
isosceles
triangles
;
so
that
if
we
regard
the
elements
as
molecules
<error>
we
may
view
the
triangles
as
atoms
of
the
material
substrate
<error>
<error>
Doubtless
it
was
this
geometrical
account
of
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
ascribed
to
Plato
that
<error>
God
always
geometrizes
<error>
-
-
for
God
<error>
says
Plutarch
in
his
commentary
on
the
saying
<error>
made
the
world
in
no
other
way
than
by
setting
terms
to
infinite
and
chaotic
matter
<error>
<error>
There
seems
to
have
been
many
attempts
to
find
a
solution
to
this
problem
raised
by
Plato
;
and
apparently
as
many
failures
<error>
For
instance
<error>
the
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
remarks
;
<error>
Nearly
all
the
old
philosophers
devised
an
harmonic
theory
with
respect
to
the
universe
<error>
and
the
practice
continued
till
the
old
mode
of
philosophizing
died
out
<error>
<error>
Kepler
<error>
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
Platonic
doctrine
<error>
that
the
universe
was
formed
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
proposed
the
following
rule
<error>
<error>
The
earth
is
a
circle
<error>
the
measurer
of
all
<error>
Round
it
describe
a
dodecahedron
;
the
circle
inclosing
this
will
be
Mars
<error>
Round
Mars
describe
a
tetrahedron
;
the
sphere
inclosing
this
will
be
Jupiter
<error>
Describe
a
cube
round
Jupiter
;
the
sphere
containing
this
will
be
Saturn
<error>
Now
inscribe
in
the
earth
an
icosahedron
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Venus
<error>
Inscribe
an
octahedron
in
Venus
;
the
circle
inscribed
in
it
will
be
Mercury
<error>
<error>
(
<error>
Mysterium
Cosmographicum
<error>
<error>
1596
)
<error>
<error>
This
rule
cannot
be
taken
seriously
as
a
real
statement
of
the
proportions
of
the
cosmos
<error>
for
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
ratios
published
by
Copernicus
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
<error>
Yet
Kepler
was
very
proud
of
his
formula
<error>
and
said
he
valued
it
more
than
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
<error>
It
was
also
approved
by
those
two
eminent
authorities
<error>
Tycho
and
Galileo
<error>
who
evidently
understood
it
<error>
Kepler
himself
never
gives
the
least
hint
of
how
his
precious
rule
is
to
be
interpreted
<error>
<error>
The
author
of
<error>
The
Canon
<error>
then
submits
a
proposed
plan
of
finding
universal
measurements
symbolically
concealed
in
the
above
rule
<error>
but
in
order
to
do
this
he
assumes
that
the
figures
need
not
be
taken
as
solids
but
as
so
many
regular
plane
polygons
<error>
But
this
seems
to
me
quite
a
departure
from
the
problem
<error>
Also
Plato
connected
these
solids
with
the
Elements
rather
than
with
the
Planets
<error>
But
I
think
our
complex
solid
will
be
found
to
contain
those
mentioned
by
Plato
<error>
although
such
a
thought
did
not
enter
my
mind
until
quite
lately
<error>
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
Qabalists
attribute
the
four
elements
to
Malkuth
<error>
which
is
often
called
the
Sphere
of
the
Elements
<error>
Now
Malkuth
has
remained
a
perfect
Sphere
in
our
plan
and
in
fact
represents
the
Material
Substance
of
the
Universe
<error>
But
the
Qabalists
have
in
particular
attributed
to
Malkuth
the
Element
of
Earth
<error>
while
to
the
next
three
Sephiroth
<error>
Yesod
<error>
Hod
<error>
and
Netzach
<error>
have
been
assigned
Air
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Fire
<error>
Earth
<error>
as
Matter
<error>
has
always
been
symbolized
by
the
Cube
<error>
or
the
Cube
within
the
Sphere
<error>
and
we
may
well
consider
this
Cube
to
be
concealed
in
the
Sphere
of
Malkuth
<error>
The
lower
section
of
the
Prismatic
Tree
<error>
that
representing
the
four
lower
Sephiroth
of
the
Elements
<error>
is
in
the
form
of
a
perfect
tetrahedron
<error>
that
is
to
say
<error>
a
solid
bounded
by
four
plane
triangular
faces
<error>
each
of
which
is
equilateral
<error>
And
again
we
find
this
same
solid
with
a
central
core
of
Fire
-
-
the
Path
of
Shin
-
-
comprising
the
combinations
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
and
Tiphereth
<error>
Plato
particularly
attributes
this
form
to
Fire
<error>
That
portion
of
our
Complete
Complex
Solid
<error>
representing
the
Elemental
Sephiroth
;
viz
<error>
<error>
up
to
the
Planes
of
<error>
The
Hierophant
<error>
which
are
penetrated
by
the
Central
Paths
of
Mem
<error>
or
Water
<error>
is
composed
of
twenty
of
the
above
solids
so
conjoined
as
to
produce
a
perfect
icosahedron
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
-
-
a
solid
bounded
by
twenty
equilateral
triangles
<error>
This
is
particularly
attributed
to
Water
in
the
Platonic
scheme
<error>
When
the
progression
is
made
to
include
Tiphereth
<error>
the
twenty
equilateral
planes
become
points
<error>
or
tripods
which
mark
out
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
while
the
Second
Progression
of
the
Tree
exactly
encloses
this
<error>
The
points
of
the
twenty
Kethers
indicate
a
similar
but
larger
solid
<error>
Thus
we
have
disposed
of
four
of
the
five
regular
solids
<error>
The
last
<error>
or
octahedron
<error>
presents
some
difficulty
<error>
This
is
a
solid
bounded
by
eight
equal
and
equilateral
plane
surfaces
<error>
and
six
summits
or
vertices
<error>
I
have
so
far
been
unable
to
discover
that
such
a
solid
exists
within
our
complex
solid
while
deriving
its
surfaces
and
angles
from
regular
sections
of
the
Tree
<error>
But
what
a
first
sight
appears
a
difficulty
may
possibly
become
a
clue
when
we
consider
that
this
form
is
attributed
to
the
Elements
of
Air
<error>
Fire
<error>
Water
<error>
and
Earth
are
all
perceptible
to
our
sense
of
sight
-
-
not
so
Air
<error>
I
do
not
want
this
to
appear
as
an
evasion
of
the
issue
<error>
for
in
any
case
there
are
interesting
indications
of
this
missing
form
in
the
Tree
of
Life
as
originally
outlined
<error>
It
will
be
found
that
four
small
equilateral
triangles
are
shown
on
the
Tree
uniting
the
Six
Sephiroth
which
are
attributed
to
Vau
in
the
Four
-
lettered
Name
<error>
and
Vau
is
the
letter
of
Air
<error>
These
four
triangles
are
arranged
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
xxxvi
here
]
It
will
be
found
that
if
a
plane
surface
be
folded
on
the
lines
where
these
triangles
join
<error>
and
if
the
points
represented
by
Chesed
and
Geburah
be
drawn
together
<error>
it
forms
exactly
one
-
half
of
an
Octahedron
<error>
And
it
may
further
be
noted
that
<error>
leaving
out
from
the
figure
of
the
whole
Tree
that
portion
which
represents
our
tetrahedron
<error>
plus
Kether
<error>
the
remainder
has
the
following
form
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVII
here
]
This
<error>
it
will
be
observed
<error>
represents
the
portion
just
described
which
makes
up
the
half
-
octahedron
<error>
together
with
just
enough
additional
surface
material
to
form
four
other
equilateral
triangles
required
for
the
completion
of
the
figure
<error>
But
<error>
without
severing
the
fragments
<error>
we
cannot
take
a
sheet
of
paper
and
fold
it
into
the
desired
shape
<error>
as
was
the
case
when
making
the
solid
prismatic
Tree
itself
<error>
But
even
in
the
latter
case
a
very
interesting
thing
will
be
noticed
-
-
the
summit
of
the
Supernal
Triad
disappears
<error>
For
<error>
whether
we
take
Three
Trees
connected
at
the
side
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXVIII
here
]
or
Three
Trees
radiating
from
Kether
thus
<error>
[
insert
figure
XXXIX
here
]
we
find
<error>
upon
experiment
in
folding
<error>
that
although
the
lower
triangle
fits
together
perfectly
<error>
when
we
bend
the
paper
back
along
the
lines
of
the
Path
of
Aquarius
we
get
a
flat
top
with
Kether
on
a
level
with
Chokmah
and
Binah
<error>
Therefore
<error>
although
for
the
sake
of
retaining
the
appearance
of
the
original
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
we
must
build
up
a
Summit
to
represent
Kether
;
we
do
so
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
with
apologies
to
the
Supreme
One
which
must
ever
remain
unmanifest
to
our
lower
senses
<error>
In
other
words
the
Summit
of
the
Supernals
cannot
be
conceived
as
a
<error>
solid
<error>
<error>
or
even
as
partaking
of
<error>
form
<error>
in
the
realm
of
ideas
<error>
This
<error>
rather
than
detracting
from
our
plan
<error>
leads
us
to
a
most
important
truth
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
that
in
our
researches
we
must
never
for
a
moment
forget
the
Superessential
excellence
of
the
ONE
and
the
GOOD
<error>
For
<error>
as
Simplicius
beautifully
observes
<error>
<error>
It
is
requisite
that
he
who
ascends
to
the
principle
of
things
<error>
should
investigate
whether
it
is
possible
there
can
be
anything
better
than
the
supposed
principle
;
and
if
something
more
excellent
is
found
<error>
the
same
inquiry
should
again
be
made
respecting
that
<error>
till
we
arrive
at
the
highest
conception
<error>
than
which
we
have
no
longer
any
more
venerable
<error>
Nor
should
we
stop
in
our
ascent
till
we
find
this
to
be
the
case
<error>
For
there
is
no
occasion
to
fear
that
our
progression
will
be
through
an
unsubstantial
void
<error>
by
conceiving
something
about
the
first
principles
which
is
greater
than
and
surpasses
their
nature
<error>
For
it
is
not
possible
for
our
conceptions
to
take
such
a
mighty
leap
as
to
equal
<error>
and
much
less
to
pass
beyond
the
dignity
of
the
first
principle
of
things
<error>
<error>
He
adds
<error>
<error>
This
<error>
therefore
<error>
is
one
and
the
best
extension
(
of
the
soul
)
to
(
the
highest
)
God
<error>
and
is
as
much
as
possible
irreprehensible
;
viz
<error>
<error>
to
know
firmly
<error>
that
by
ascribing
to
him
the
most
venerable
excellencies
we
can
conceive
<error>
and
the
most
holy
and
primary
names
and
things
<error>
we
ascribe
nothing
to
him
which
is
suitable
to
his
dignity
<error>
It
is
sufficient
<error>
however
<error>
to
procure
our
pardon
(
for
the
attempt
)
that
we
can
attribute
to
him
nothing
superior
<error>
<error>
And
in
respect
of
our
pardon
we
may
devoutly
hope
that
Simplicius
was
right
<error>
Chapter
11
Plato
said
in
regard
to
the
Elements
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
God
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
<error>
<error>
We
have
had
something
to
say
about
Form
but
have
touched
very
little
upon
Number
<error>
It
will
be
well
for
use
to
make
a
few
observations
in
the
light
of
the
Forms
we
have
reconstructed
<error>
I
shall
have
little
to
say
in
regard
to
the
Numbers
attributed
to
the
ordinary
Qabalistic
Plan
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
these
having
been
dealt
with
in
<error>
Q
<error>
B
<error>
L
<error>
<error>
and
elsewhere
<error>
It
is
merely
necessary
to
recapitulate
as
follows
<error>
The
simple
two
-
dimensional
figure
consists
of
10
Sephiroth
;
10
being
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
4
<error>
This
importance
of
this
lies
in
the
Fourfold
Nature
of
the
Ineffable
Name
which
is
the
Formula
of
the
whole
System
<error>
There
are
22
(
2
+
2
=
4
)
connecting
links
or
Paths
<error>
These
consist
of
3
+
7
+
12
<error>
and
correspond
to
the
Elements
<error>
Planets
<error>
and
Signs
of
the
Zodiac
<error>
In
all
we
have
32
<error>
called
<error>
in
relation
to
this
System
<error>
the
32
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
representing
the
whole
figure
<error>
One
of
the
special
virtues
of
this
number
is
that
it
represents
the
coalescence
of
Macroprosopus
and
Microprosopus
in
the
Divine
Name
AHIHVH
<error>
and
thus
shows
the
connection
between
Kether
-
-
The
Highest
Crown
-
-
and
the
Nine
lower
Sephiroth
<error>
which
emanated
from
it
<error>
When
we
allow
this
simple
figure
to
expand
in
one
direction
<error>
as
previously
explained
<error>
we
find
<error>
since
Malkuth
remains
One
and
the
same
throughout
<error>
that
the
Second
Tree
contains
19
Sephiroth
<error>
which
is
a
prime
number
<error>
reduces
by
addition
to
10
<error>
Likewise
the
Third
Tree
consists
of
28
Sephiroth
<error>
a
Perfect
Number
which
again
reduces
to
the
original
10
and
therefore
to
1
or
Unity
<error>
The
Fourth
Tree
contains
37
Sephiroth
<error>
another
prime
number
reducing
to
10
<error>
The
Fifth
gives
46
which
reduces
to
10
<error>
while
the
Sixth
represents
55
which
not
only
does
this
but
is
the
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
1
to
10
<error>
And
since
the
number
of
the
Sephiroth
will
be
increased
by
9
at
every
progression
<error>
their
total
<error>
at
each
step
<error>
will
always
reduce
to
10
by
addition
<error>
The
22
Paths
of
the
first
figure
will
increase
by
20
<error>
s
to
42
<error>
62
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
since
two
of
these
-
-
Beth
and
Daleth
-
-
retain
their
own
nature
indefinitely
<error>
Thus
the
progressions
of
the
whole
Tree
will
be
from
the
original
32
to
61
and
so
on
;
29
being
added
each
time
<error>
We
may
now
consider
the
outstanding
features
of
the
figure
when
shown
expanding
in
Six
directions
as
the
Snowflake
<error>
Since
Netzach
and
Hod
now
combine
we
have
in
all
49
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
figure
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
a
distinctly
Venusian
Number
(
that
of
the
Intelligence
of
Venus
)
and
the
Square
of
Seven
<error>
It
reduces
to
13
<error>
the
number
of
Unity
and
Love
<error>
The
number
of
Paths
in
this
figure
is
126
(
a
number
attributed
to
two
important
Names
of
God
)
and
this
<error>
added
to
49
<error>
gives
175
as
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
<error>
This
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
Number
of
the
Spirit
of
Venus
<error>
It
represents
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
49
divided
by
7
<error>
and
it
again
reduces
to
13
by
addition
<error>
When
we
consider
the
progressions
of
this
Sixfold
Figure
we
find
the
Sephiroth
increase
by
48
each
time
<error>
Malkuth
remaining
single
<error>
This
is
of
interest
because
48
is
the
numeration
of
KVKB
<error>
the
Sphere
of
Mercury
<error>
and
we
find
the
particular
feature
of
this
Sixfold
plan
is
that
the
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
forever
united
<error>
I
have
always
considered
this
word
Kokab
to
be
in
some
way
connected
with
the
words
Khu
and
Khabs
;
Khu
being
the
Magickal
entity
of
man
<error>
and
Khabs
meaning
a
Star
<error>
Considering
this
arrangement
is
as
a
Sixfold
Star
and
the
uniting
of
the
Paths
and
Spheres
of
Venus
and
Mercury
as
Love
under
Will
<error>
this
will
be
interesting
to
Students
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
The
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
Second
progression
is
therefore
49
+
48
=
97
<error>
This
is
another
prime
number
and
that
of
the
Archangel
of
Netzach
<error>
It
has
many
other
correspondences
<error>
one
of
which
is
<error>
An
architect
<error>
<error>
The
next
progression
gives
us
145
which
<error>
according
to
the
old
arrangement
<error>
corresponds
to
the
13
Paths
of
the
Beard
of
Microprosopus
<error>
But
the
Fourth
progression
produces
193
<error>
another
prime
number
of
particular
importance
since
it
is
the
Number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
unprogressed
but
complete
three
-
dimensional
solid
which
forms
the
Dodecahedron
<error>
193
also
reduces
to
13
<error>
which
<error>
it
may
be
remarked
<error>
is
the
number
of
Sephiroth
in
the
single
prismatic
solid
<error>
The
126
Paths
of
the
sixfold
plan
progress
by
adding
120
each
time
(
since
the
Paths
of
Venus
and
Mercury
are
combined
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
Number
to
the
Rosicrucian
<error>
and
on
account
of
its
representing
the
God
ON
<error>
Other
interesting
numbers
can
be
traced
out
by
the
Student
who
possesses
a
copy
of
the
Sepher
Sephiroth
<error>
The
whole
figure
progresses
by
the
addition
of
168
(
the
additional
48
Sephiroth
and
120
Paths
)
and
this
is
a
very
important
number
<error>
being
that
of
the
Parentes
Superni
<error>
We
may
now
engage
in
a
brief
consideration
of
the
Solid
Figure
<error>
The
first
simple
form
contains
13
Sephiroth
<error>
which
number
gives
it
the
Seal
of
Unity
<error>
This
solid
also
contains
13
parts
which
produces
the
angles
representing
the
Paths
<error>
Thus
it
represents
26
<error>
the
Number
of
the
Ineffable
Name
<error>
When
this
solid
is
extended
in
20
directions
(
20
is
the
full
numeration
of
IVD
<error>
the
first
letter
of
the
Name
spelled
in
full
)
193
Sephiroth
are
produced
<error>
These
added
to
the
260
(
13
X
20
)
parts
give
453
<error>
a
number
reducing
to
12
which
is
the
number
of
pentagonal
faces
on
the
20
-
pointed
dodecahedron
<error>
But
<error>
which
is
perhaps
of
greater
interest
<error>
this
number
453
is
that
of
NPSh
ChIH
<error>
the
Animal
Soul
in
its
fullness
;
i
<error>
e
<error>
<error>
including
the
Creative
Entity
or
Chiah
<error>
The
importance
of
this
will
be
plain
when
we
remember
that
the
total
number
of
Sephiroth
and
Paths
in
the
Whole
Solid
is
-
-
as
has
been
shown
in
Chapter
VII
-
-
775
and
this
<error>
added
to
the
260
parts
or
sectional
solids
<error>
gives
1035
<error>
which
is
the
sum
of
the
numbers
from
1
to
45
<error>
Now
45
being
the
numeration
of
ADM
(
Adam
)
indicates
that
we
have
once
more
shown
the
Qabalistic
ADAM
in
all
his
Spiritual
and
Animal
fullness
and
that
he
once
again
contains
the
sum
of
all
his
parts
<error>
Also
the
20
points
and
12
faces
of
the
dodecahedron
equal
32
<error>
the
original
number
of
the
Paths
of
Wisdom
<error>
One
other
point
seems
worthy
of
notice
in
this
connection
<error>
The
<error>
Sepher
<error>
Yetzirah
<error>
makes
a
very
strong
feature
of
TEN
Sephiroth
(
ten
and
not
nine
<error>
ten
and
not
eleven
)
<error>
and
it
may
be
assumed
that
we
have
departed
entirely
from
this
fundamental
conception
<error>
But
it
is
also
true
that
the
ancient
Qabalists
considered
the
Three
Veils
of
the
Negative
-
-
AIN
<error>
AIN
SUPH
<error>
AIN
SUPH
AUR
-
-
as
depending
back
from
Kether
;
thus
<error>
although
these
are
<error>
unmanifest
<error>
<error>
the
whole
scheme
was
based
on
13
<error>
It
may
be
further
remarked
that
there
are
Seven
Sephiroth
below
the
Supernal
Triad
and
the
Three
unmanifest
Ideas
above
<error>
so
that
we
have
<error>
as
it
were
<error>
7
+
3
=
10
<error>
10
+
3
=
13
;
the
10
standing
midway
between
the
7
and
the
13
<error>
Now
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
progressions
of
the
single
Tree
are
made
by
the
addition
of
nines
<error>
so
that
each
number
produced
reduces
to
10
when
we
add
the
digits
<error>
In
this
case
<error>
then
<error>
the
essence
of
the
original
basis
remains
<error>
Nor
is
this
basis
lost
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
two
-
dimensional
figure
<error>
the
Single
Prismatic
solid
<error>
and
the
Twenty
-
fold
solid
and
their
progressions
<error>
although
it
is
more
deeply
concealed
in
these
instances
<error>
All
these
start
from
a
basis
of
13
<error>
The
Single
solid
has
13
Sephiroth
and
increases
by
the
addition
of
12
at
each
progression
<error>
Thus
the
series
is
13
<error>
25
<error>
37
<error>
49
<error>
61
<error>
73
<error>
85
<error>
etc
<error>
If
we
reduce
these
by
addition
(
leaving
the
first
as
it
stands
)
we
obtain
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
Now
this
is
the
series
we
noticed
above
in
regard
to
the
original
Tree
-
-
the
10
Sephiroth
with
three
Veils
above
the
Supernal
Triad
and
7
Spheres
below
it
<error>
And
this
series
recurs
with
every
three
progressions
<error>
so
that
since
7
+
10
+
13
=
30
<error>
the
average
is
still
<error>
in
essence
<error>
10
throughout
<error>
And
when
we
consider
the
Sixfold
Plan
we
start
with
49
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
48
<error>
Now
48
being
4
times
12
we
find
we
are
running
in
a
series
which
coincides
at
certain
definite
points
with
the
previous
one
<error>
and
the
same
peculiar
rule
is
noticed
in
regard
to
our
reductions
of
digits
<error>
Thus
<error>
49
<error>
97
<error>
145
<error>
193
<error>
241
<error>
289
<error>
337
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
reduce
to
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
7
<error>
10
<error>
13
<error>
etc
<error>
as
before
<error>
The
same
is
true
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
We
begin
with
193
which
reduces
to
13
<error>
and
progress
by
adding
192
;
which
in
this
case
is
4
times
48
<error>
Therefor
we
find
the
same
underlying
law
if
we
consider
193
<error>
385
<error>
577
<error>
769
<error>
961
<error>
1153
<error>
1345
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
with
the
exception
of
the
one
instance
of
769
<error>
which
reduces
to
22
(
the
number
of
paths
)
on
its
way
to
its
final
reduction
to
4
without
first
forming
13
as
in
all
the
other
cases
<error>
And
we
of
course
find
that
every
fourth
progression
of
one
series
coincides
with
the
number
produced
by
one
of
the
others
<error>
Thus
the
fourth
progression
of
the
Prism
gives
us
49
which
is
the
basic
number
of
the
Star
<error>
The
fourth
progression
of
the
Star
gives
us
193
<error>
the
basic
number
of
the
complete
solid
<error>
and
so
on
<error>
In
fact
every
progression
of
the
Star
will
give
a
number
which
is
that
of
some
progression
of
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
<error>
every
<error>
progression
of
the
Complex
Solid
a
number
equal
to
some
progression
of
both
the
Star
and
the
Simple
Solid
<error>
and
the
numbers
common
to
all
will
always
reduce
to
13
(
or
4
)
<error>
A
word
now
in
regard
to
the
proportion
of
the
various
parts
of
our
figures
<error>
We
found
in
constructing
the
first
simple
plan
of
the
Sephiroth
and
Paths
that
the
proportion
of
the
Diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
to
the
Width
of
the
Paths
was
very
important
<error>
especially
in
regard
to
the
Progressions
<error>
I
noticed
recently
that
in
his
footnotes
to
the
new
edition
of
Eliphas
Levi
<error>
s
Transcendental
Magic
<error>
Mr
<error>
A
<error>
E
<error>
Waite
makes
the
following
remarks
<error>
evidently
with
the
intention
of
discrediting
Levi
<error>
<error>
In
the
Tree
of
Life
KETHER
<error>
the
Supreme
Crown
<error>
abides
above
CHOKMAH
and
BINAH
<error>
forming
with
these
the
Supernal
Triad
<error>
below
which
are
CHESED
and
GEBURAH
<error>
It
must
be
said
further
that
the
Tree
comprises
three
triangles
<error>
beneath
which
is
MALKUTH
<error>
There
is
<error>
no
<error>
circle
<error>
<error>
as
Levi
suggests
<error>
except
in
the
accidental
sense
that
the
names
and
titles
of
each
Sephira
are
inscribed
within
this
figure
<error>
<error>
Without
some
idea
of
a
Circle
or
Sphere
<error>
if
only
to
represent
the
Absolute
or
the
Universe
<error>
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
Qabalistic
Scheme
at
all
;
and
that
all
the
Qabalists
have
merely
used
the
Sephiroth
as
convenient
receptacles
for
names
and
inscriptions
while
giving
to
the
Paths
any
semblance
of
reality
<error>
seems
to
me
rather
puerile
<error>
However
<error>
since
the
very
Points
representing
the
Centers
of
the
Sephiroth
in
any
properly
proportioned
<error>
Tree
<error>
are
produced
by
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
we
may
leave
aside
Mr
<error>
Waite
<error>
s
remarks
and
consider
the
matter
as
if
the
Sephiroth
were
<error>
Circles
<error>
and
the
Paths
<error>
Lines
<error>
<error>
In
the
construction
of
the
Tree
we
commence
with
4
generating
circles
<error>
These
may
be
of
any
desired
size
<error>
but
by
their
means
we
obtain
the
Centers
of
the
Ten
Sephiroth
<error>
The
logical
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
will
be
found
to
be
one
-
fourth
of
that
of
the
generating
circles
<error>
This
makes
the
length
of
the
short
Paths
-
-
such
as
Aleph
-
-
exactly
equal
to
the
diameter
of
each
Sephiroth
<error>
Next
<error>
in
order
to
discover
the
logical
width
of
the
Paths
we
should
examine
the
structure
of
the
Tree
where
the
five
Paths
from
above
unite
in
Tiphereth
and
the
three
proceed
from
below
that
sphere
<error>
It
will
be
noticed
that
the
natural
division
of
the
circle
will
be
into
12
<error>
as
this
will
make
all
the
Paths
the
same
width
and
leave
a
space
equal
to
the
width
of
one
path
between
the
lower
ones
<error>
Thus
the
width
of
each
Path
should
be
one
-
half
the
radius
of
the
Sephira
<error>
(
The
greatest
possible
width
without
the
Paths
conflicting
with
one
another
above
Tiphereth
<error>
)
When
it
comes
to
the
progression
of
the
Trees
we
shall
then
find
that
the
third
will
produce
Sephiroth
equal
in
diameter
to
the
original
generating
circles
<error>
while
the
width
of
the
Paths
of
the
third
progression
will
be
exactly
that
of
the
diameter
of
the
Sephiroth
of
the
first
Tree
<error>
A
glance
at
the
Colored
Plate
will
show
how
exactly
all
the
details
fit
in
if
this
plan
is
adopted
;
even
in
the
case
of
the
four
-
fold
division
of
Malkuth
the
progressed
Paths
exactly
coincide
with
the
diagonals
<error>
(
See
Plate
A
<error>
)
It
should
be
remembered
<error>
however
<error>
that
all
our
measurements
are
made
from
<error>
center
<error>
to
<error>
center
<error>
of
the
Sephiroth
<error>
As
a
further
check
on
the
correctness
of
the
size
of
the
Sephiroth
we
find
that
a
Vesica
constructed
upon
the
Path
from
the
center
of
Chesed
to
that
of
Geburah
<error>
having
a
length
from
Kether
to
Yesod
<error>
will
exactly
touch
the
<error>
circumferences
<error>
of
Chokmah
<error>
Binah
<error>
Netzach
<error>
and
Hod
<error>
Our
final
summary
will
deal
with
the
proportions
of
the
whole
figure
as
based
on
those
of
the
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
We
have
shown
the
importance
of
15
to
26
(
the
proportions
of
the
Vesica
)
in
relation
to
the
sacred
Names
IH
and
IHVH
<error>
The
Student
may
consider
for
himself
such
further
proportions
in
this
series
as
30
to
52
<error>
60
to
104
<error>
120
to
208
<error>
240
to
416
<error>
The
last
of
these
is
of
peculiar
interest
for
240
is
NTzNIM
<error>
Prima
Germina
<error>
and
416
is
HRHVR
<error>
meaning
Thought
or
Meditation
<error>
Again
the
next
proportion
<error>
480
to
932
<error>
is
important
<error>
480
is
LILITh
and
932
is
OTz
HDOTh
TVB
VRO
<error>
The
Tree
of
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
<error>
This
is
surely
a
valuable
correspondence
worthy
of
study
<error>
But
there
is
another
set
of
proportions
in
connection
with
the
Vesica
<error>
viz
<error>
<error>
30
to
52
<error>
30
is
the
Letter
of
Libra
-
-
Balance
;
52
is
the
numeration
of
ABA
VAMA
(
Father
and
Mother
)
<error>
AIMA
(
The
Supernal
Mother
-
-
fertilized
)
<error>
and
of
BN
(
The
Son
<error>
Assiah
<error>
s
<error>
Secret
Nature
<error>
)
<error>
The
correspondence
between
these
and
Balance
is
an
interesting
one
<error>
Further
we
may
use
52
to
90
<error>
for
90
is
SVD

The

<error>
This
<error>
as
applied
to
ABA
VAMA
<error>
AIMA
<error>
or
BN
leads
to
ideas
suitable
for
the
highest
<error>
meditation
<error>
about
which
we
should
be
<error>
very
silent
<error>
<error>
(
Strangely
enough
<error>
as
I
wrote
this
I
noticed
another
correspondence
<error>
for
ZMH
<error>
Meditation
<error>
adds
to
52
<error>
and
DOMM
<error>
Very
Silent
<error>
adds
to
90
<error>
I
shall
therefore
take
this
as
a
hint
and
pass
on
<error>
)
The
next
proportion
90
to
156
is
of
even
deeper
significance
for
here
we
find
the
relation
between
<error>
The
Mystery
of
Sex
<error>
(
90
)
and
BABALON
(
156
)
The
Victorious
Queen
<error>
(
See
XXX
Aethyrs
<error>
Liber
CDXVIII
)
<error>
And
the
very
next
progression
156
to
260
gives
us
a
relation
between
BABALON
(
156
)
and
I
<error>
N
<error>
R
<error>
I
<error>
(
270
)
<error>
Enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
to
the
Adept
that
a
study
of
these
proportions
is
well
worth
while
<error>
But
<error>
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
with
the
actual
proportions
of
the
Vesica
<error>
and
we
have
not
mentioned
those
of
the
complete
Tree
of
Life
itself
<error>
Those
of
the
Vesica
being
as
26
to
45
we
see
the
proportions
of
the
Tree
must
be
26
to
60
<error>
or
<error>
since
we
can
divide
by
2
<error>
we
may
put
them
at
13
to
30
<error>
Here
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
our
basic
number
13
(
Unity
and
Love
)
in
right
relation
with
<error>
Balance
<error>
<error>
For
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
Basis
of
the
Work
<error>
<error>
We
again
obtain
an
interesting
series
of
proportions
<error>
13
to
30
<error>
26
to
60
<error>
52
to
120
<error>
104
to
240
<error>
208
to
480
<error>
416
to
960
<error>
etc
<error>
<error>
but
these
will
again
be
left
to
the
consideration
of
the
Student
for
we
have
yet
to
deal
with
a
greater
Mystery
<error>
If
13
to
30
is
the
exact
width
and
height
of
the
two
-
dimensional
figure
of
the
Tree
of
Life
<error>
what
will
be
the
proportions
that
will
give
us
the
correct
angle
of
the
Supernal
Triad
in
order
to
change
this
to
a
Solid
<error>
The
present
angle
is
120
degrees
<error>
the
interior
angle
of
the
Hexagon
;
what
proportion
will
give
us
the
interior
angle
of
the
Solid
Pentagon
by
which
Kether
<error>
Chokmah
<error>
and
Binah
take
their
places
each
touching
the
circumscribing
SPHERE
<error>
This
final
revelation
<error>
only
made
to
us
on
May
30
th
<error>
1925
<error>
yet
necessary
to
the
completion
of
our
treatise
<error>
has
come
as
the
Seal
of
the
Supreme
upon
our
Work
<error>
It
is
not
possible
to
enter
into
the
proper
consideration
of
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
relation
to
the
Magical
lifework
of
the
Author
and
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
For
the
present
<error>
therefore
<error>
we
simply
state
this
proportion
to
be
as
THIRTEEN
is
to
THIRTY
-
ONE
<error>
13
to
31
gives
the
exact
angle
of
108
degrees
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
our
solid
<error>
the
additional
part
being
used
to
raise
the
Point
of
Kether
to
the
Pinnacle
of
the
Solid
<error>
But
let
us
examine
the
progressions
of
this
proportion
as
before
<error>
We
obtain
<error>
13
to
31
<error>
26
to
62
<error>
52
to
124
<error>
104
to
248
and
208
to
496
<error>
This
last
<error>
be
it
noted
<error>
is
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
<error>
Now
let
us
remember
that
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
Progression
of
Malkuth
as
an
expanding
Sphere
is
the
one
which
First
embraces
the
Kether
of
the
First
Tree
(
and
the
Dodecahedron
formed
by
the
Tiphereths
of
the
Second
Tree
)
<error>
How
many
Sephiroth
shall
we
find
in
the
Complete
Solid
at
the
Fifth
Progression
<error>
193
+
192
+
192
+
192
+
192
=
961
<error>
Therefore
when
the
Sephiroth
have
increased
to
961
in
the
Solid
<error>
<error>
Malkuth
<error>
will
have
expanded
to
the
First
Kether
<error>
961
<error>
happens
<error>
to
be
31
X
31
<error>
or
the
Square
of
31
<error>
and
it
reduces
to
13
<error>
But
what
of
our
<error>
Proportion
<error>
of
208
to
496
<error>
the
<error>
Fifth
<error>
progression
of
the
proportions
of
13
to
31
<error>
Not
only
is
208
<error>
the
<error>
width
<error>
of
our
Tree
<error>
equal
to
the
<error>
length
<error>
of
a
Pure
Vesica
whose
breadth
is
120
(
our
original
Kether
angle
)
<error>
but
our
other
proportion
496
is
a
<error>
Perfect
<error>
Number
<error>
the
<error>
Sum
of
the
Numbers
from
One
to
Thirty
-
One
<error>
<error>
and
the
<error>
Numeration
<error>
of
MLKVTh
-
-
Malkuth
<error>
AL
<error>
it
must
be
remembered
<error>
is
the
Highest
Kether
Name
of
God
-
-
31
-
-
which
being
read
in
reverse
is
LA
<error>
Not
<error>
and
thus
forms
the
true
formula
of
the
transition
from
the
unmanifest
to
the
manifest
<error>
Let
us
never
forget
that
the
True
Kether
-
-
Hadit
-
-
is
forever
concealed
in
the
Center
of
Malkuth
<error>
and
that
of
this
it
has
been
written
in
Liber
AL
vel
Legis
<error>
I
am
NOT
(
La

)
extended
(
1
+
2
+

<error>
<error>
<error>
31
=
496
)
and
Khabs
(
a
Star
)
is
the
Name
of
my
House
<error>
In
concluding
this
section
we
may
remark
that
the
76
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
and
the
19
th
progression
of
the
Star
<error>
show

913
is

<error>
Berashith

In
the
Beginning
<error>

the
First
Word
of
Genesis
<error>
The
80
th
progression
of
the
Single
Solid
<error>
the
20
th
of
the
Star
<error>
and
the
5
th
of
the
Complete
Solid
<error>
all
give
961
(
13
x
31
)
<error>
and
in
case
you
should
forget
this
<error>
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stand
in
The
Kingdom
<error>
Malkuth
(
496
)
<error>
and
LOOK
UP
<error>
You
will
then
see
Yesod
(

)
and
above
that
Tiphereth
(

)
and

the
Grace
of

So

be
<error>
Chapter
XII
Our
intention
was
not
that
this
should
be
a
long
treatise
<error>
but
rather
to
give
the
gist
of
our
discoveries
to
the
world
<error>
thus
allowing
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
this
System
to
be
minded
and
used
by
any
who
desire
to
grasp
the
opportunity
<error>
But
this
work
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
had
a
few
words
to
say
upon
the
possibilities
of
using
this
Plan
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
build
a
new
and
more
glorious
Temple
than
has
been
conceived
in
the
past
<error>
by
the
mind
of
Man
<error>
My
first
appeal
is
therefore
made
to
all
Architects
<error>
and
it
is
made
in
the
Name
of
the
Great
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
the
Designs
of
Whose
Trestle
-
Board
<error>
we
cannot
but
feel
<error>
have
been
transmitted
to
us
in
such
a
marvelous
manner
<error>
The
author
feels
that
this
represents
the
revelation
of
the
<error>
Formative
Plane
<error>
of
the
Holy
Qabalah
<error>
which
contains
the
Influence
of
the
<error>
Archetypal
<error>
and
<error>
Creative
<error>
Worlds
<error>
and
through
which
the
Material
Universe
came
into
manifestation
<error>
The
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
marvelous
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
and
the
<error>
Trinity
in
Unity
<error>
so
much
influenced
the
minds
of
Men
in
the
Middle
Ages
<error>
that
a
vast
number
of
beautiful
Gothic
Cathedrals
were
planned
and
built
with
every
detail
lovingly
worked
out
so
as
to
symbolize
the
highest
religious
truths
then
open
to
the
minds
of
men
<error>
in
a
material
form
<error>
These
Gothic
structures
are
certainly
admitted
to
be
the
most
beautiful
in
design
<error>
but
to
some
extent
the
secret
of
their
proportions
has
been
lost
<error>
The
Spirit
behind
such
buildings
has
been
overlooked
<error>
and
modern
Architects
have
not
had
the
same
urge
and
impulse
towards
planning
such
perfect
work
<error>
But
even
in
Gothic
Churches
<error>
the
symbolism
of
the
Ground
Plans
was
comparatively
narrow
in
conception
<error>
and
pricipally
based
on
the
Christian
ideas
of
the
Cross
<error>
although
of
course
the
Cross
has
a
wonderful
Natural
symbolism
which
is
far
older
than
what
we
term
Christianity
<error>
But
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
in
the
History
of
Mankind
<error>
has
it
been
so
necessary
that
a
Universal
Temple
be
built
;
never
before
<error>
perhaps
<error>
have
the
plans
been
available
<error>
When
we
realize
that
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
not
only
partakes
of
all
the
properties
of
the
<error>
Vesica
Piscis
<error>
but
in
addition
to
symbolizing
the
Mysteries
of
the
Trinity
<error>
is
capable
of
forming
a
Symbolic
Basis
for
every
Idea
in
the
Universe
<error>
Natural
<error>
Human
<error>
and
Divine
(
as
a
slight
study
of
the
Qabalistic
System
will
prove
to
any
intelligent
person
)
;
what
a
wonderful
Ground
Plan
does
it
make
for
a
Universal
Temple
<error>
when
we
consider
the
possibilities
of
its
indefinite
Multiplication
as
a
Sixfold
Star
<error>
its
Prismatic
Proportions
<error>
etc
<error>
This
should
be
sufficient
to
fire
the
minds
of
the
World
<error>
s
Greatest
Architects
with
enthusiasm
to
work
out
Designs
for
the
First
Great
Temple
built
directly
upon
the
Nature
Formative
Plans
of
the
Grand
Architect
of
the
Universe
<error>
In
such
a
Temple
all
Nations
and
Peoples
might
well
meet
to
give
praise
to
the
One
Whose
Absolute
Wisdom
and
Supreme
Intelligence
has
built
this
Universe
<error>
and
made
it
possible
for
created
Man
to
comprehend
its
hidden
Designs
and
to
become
a
conscious
co
-
operator
in
the
Divine
Plan
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
temporal
charge
of
the
Spiritual
welfare
of
Mankind
;
the
Heads
of
the
various
Religions
of
the
World
<error>
those
who
claim
to
hold
the
Divine
Authority
for
the
instruction
of
Humanity
and
have
charge
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
<error>
A
Universal
Teaching
is
needed
<error>
based
upon
simple
and
intelligible
lines
<error>
A
teaching
that
at
once
conforms
with
true
Science
and
with
the
Universal
experience
of
Humanity
<error>
Hitherto
<error>
the
Great
Teachers
and
founders
of
Religions
have
come
to
certain
nations
<error>
or
countries
<error>
and
have
taught
a
suitable
doctrine
for
the
particular
climate
and
people
to
which
their
Mission
led
them
<error>
No
public
universal
teaching
has
hitherto
been
possible
on
account
of
the
lack
of
proper
means
of
communication
<error>
Today
we
have
the
means
of
flashing
the
truth
to
every
part
of
the
globe
in
a
few
minutes
<error>
There
is
no
longer
any
reason
why
a
Universal
Teaching
should
not
be
obtained
and
given
to
all
humanity
<error>
Such
an
ideal
condition
cannot
be
brought
about
while
there
is
contention
and
schism
and
conflicting
basic
ideas
within
the
Churches
themselves
<error>
I
do
not
say
that
all
humanity
should
be
taught
exactly
alike
<error>
but
I
do
say
that
there
is
but
One
Truth
<error>
and
that
One
Truth
is
back
of
every
exterior
organization
<error>
however
differently
it
may
be
interpreted
<error>
Symbolically
<error>
at
least
<error>
our
present
plan
proves
itself
to
be
the
basis
of
the
Catholic
Mysteries
;
it
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
of
the
lost
Jewish
Tradition
<error>
which
itself
came
from
Egypt
<error>
It
is
the
basis
of
Pythagorean
Philosophy
<error>
of
Geometry
;
it
is
the
basis
of
the
Rosicrucian
Mysteries
<error>
as
well
as
of
Masonry
<error>
and
will
prove
itself
to
be
the
Key
to
the
Mysteries
of
the
Secret
Schools
<error>
There
is
no
reason
why
a
Temple
build
on
such
perfect
symbolism
should
not
be
equally
sacred
to
Jewish
<error>
Catholic
<error>
Masonic
<error>
and
other
Religious
and
Philosophical
divisions
of
Humanity
<error>
wherein
each
could
behold
the
Mysteries
of
their
Tradition
and
realize
that
they
are
of
the
same
Divine
Origin
<error>
Scientifically
<error>
since
every
drop
of
water
naturally
crystallizes
in
this
way
<error>
and
Crystals
are
build
up
on
similar
lines
<error>
even
the
Materialist
must
recognize
the
Work
of
the
Creator
<error>
as
symbolized
in
such
a
structure
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
those
in
whose
charge
is
the
Civil
destiny
of
the
Nations
<error>
How
can
any
peace
of
a
lasting
nature
be
brought
about
unless
some
Universal
Plan
is
adopted
in
which
every
Nation
will
be
seen
to
have
its
definite
function
<error>
and
have
a
well
defined
destiny
<error>
An
understanding
of
the
fundamental
working
principles
of
the
Universe
<error>
and
of
the
Working
Plans
of
the
Great
Architect
<error>
is
essential
to
a
clear
vision
of
what
is
needed
to
overcome
the
present
difficulties
with
which
mankind
is
confronted
on
every
side
<error>
Things
must
be
looked
at
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
Whole
<error>
rather
than
that
of
the
Part
<error>
if
a
proper
Order
and
Arrangement
is
to
be
brought
about
<error>
Man
has
been
given
free
-
will
<error>
which
includes
the
possibility
of
making
mistakes
<error>
Man
is
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
this
Planet
<error>
and
those
in
authority
have
the
responsibility
on
their
shoulders
of
making
this
Earth
a
Heaven
or
Hell
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
<error>
Those
in
such
positions
cannot
shirk
this
responsibility
<error>
and
they
cannot
expect
to
be
long
in
power
if
they
wilfully
neglect
to
train
themselves
to
hold
their
office
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
those
in
their
charge
<error>
Let
them
remember
that
the
essence
of
Order
consists
in
the
perfect
adjustment
of
all
the
parts
in
subservience
to
the
Whole
;
and
that
<error>
conversely
<error>
it
is
fatal
folly
to
try
to
make
the
Whole
conform
to
the
design
of
some
distorted
part
<error>
Civilization
has
been
a
failure
<error>
with
all
its
apparent
improvements
and
facilities
<error>
through
failure
to
understand
this
general
principle
<error>
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
part
should
discover
its
true
function
in
relation
to
every
other
part
<error>
and
to
the
Whole
<error>
and
then
fulfillits
destiny
without
making
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
proper
functioning
of
the
other
parts
of
the
Great
Machine
<error>
Equilibrium
is
the
basis
of
the
work
<error>
Every
apparent
pair
of
opposites
can
be
reconciled
in
a
third
idea
from
which
they
both
spring
<error>
and
which
contains
the
essence
of
both
<error>
My
next
appeal
is
to
all
Thinking
people
<error>
Many
of
you
are
slaves
to
your
own
thought
<error>
You
are
limited
by
your
own
narrow
conceptions
<error>
which
must
always
be
narrow
compared
to
the
Infinite
<error>
Most
of
you
know
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
so
in
reality
<error>
To
you
I
make
this
appeal
<error>
Clean
out
your
minds
<error>
learn
to
control
thought
<error>
Arrange
you
ideas
in
proper
balanced
order
<error>
and
make
your
viewpoint
one
of
equilibrium
<error>
Base
your
mental
structure
on
the
<error>
Tree
of
Life
<error>
and
since
every
idea
placed
thereon
is
capable
of
infinite
progress
<error>
your
minds
will
expand
to
the
comprehension
of
all
that
is
within
Time
and
Space
<error>
for
the
Spirit
of
God
in
Man
is
capable
of
extending
the
Substance
of
every
Mind
which
does
not
exert
all
its
efforts
to
narrow
the
limits
of
consciousness
to
conform
to
a
few
personal
prejudices
and
petty
ideas
<error>
Why
accept
less
than
is
your
due
;
restriction
is
the
only
sin
<error>
Lastly
<error>
I
greet
the
Crowned
Children
of
the
New
Aeon
<error>
those
who
<error>
having
sworn
to
overcome
all
things
<error>
shall
obtain
the
reward
promised
to
everyone
that
overcometh
<error>
And
I
say
unto
you
<error>
as
One
did
of
old
<error>
<error>
In
my
Father
<error>
s
House
are
many
Mansions
<error>
and
if
it
were
not
so
I
would
have
told
you
<error>
<error>
But
also
I
add
<error>
There
is
a
place
prepared
for
every
one
of
you
<error>
Here
and
Now
<error>
There
is
a
place
for
everything
<error>
when
all
things
shall
be
put
in
place
<error>
Take
up
your
places
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Ever
-
Coming
Son
<error>
fulfill
yourselves
<error>
in
the
fulfillment
of
the
Will
of
God
within
you
<error>
and
show
those
who
are
still
in
darkness
without
<error>
that
there
is
room
for
all
who
are
prepared
to
keep
their
place
<error>
and
cease
from
trying
to
usurp
that
of
others
<error>
For
<error>
Love
is
the
law
<error>
love
under
will
<error>
and
through
Love
alone
may
ye
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
One
Substance
<error>
capable
of
Infinite
Multiplication
and
Projection
<error>
whereby
ye
become
actual
communicants
in
the
Body
of
God
<error>
In
the
Name
of
the
One
<error>
by
the
Grace
of
God
Triune
<error>
and
by
the
Favor
of

This
method
was
pointed
out
to
me
some
years
ago
by
Frater
Nubem
Eripiam
<error>
who
claimed
to
have
just
discovered
it
<error>
The
method
of
construction
as
given
in
Liber
777
<error>
although
producing
a
correctly
proportioned
Tree
<error>
does
not
show
the
generating
circles
<error>
and
is
not
nearly
so
simple
in
use
<error>
The
neatest
formula
indicating
the
exact
proportions
of
the
Vesica
is
as
One
is
to
the
Square
Root
of
Three
<error>
This
also
is
very
symbolic
for
it
shows
the
Unity
in
its
relation
to
a
certain
aspect
of
the
Trinity
<error>
while
since
the
numbers
represented
are
1
and
3
<error>
it
is
strongly
suggestive
of
13
=
AChD
=
Unity
<error>
The
above
is
actually
more
accurate
mathematically
than
15
<error>
6
<error>
for
the
proportion
1
to
the
square
root
of
3
=
1
<error>
732
<error>
while
15
<error>
6
=
1
<error>
733
<error>
But
there
is
always
likely
to
be
some
slight
difference
between
mathematical
accuracy
and
a
general
Magical
formula
<error>
as
witness
the
word
ALHIM
which
suggests
Pi
as
3
<error>
1415
whereas
3
<error>
1416
is
more
correct
<error>
I
hardly
know
of
a
magickal
formula
in
fractions
unless
it
be
6
/
0
=
0
<error>
12
<error>
for
which
see
Liber
Legis
and
Comment
<error>
<error>
Architecture
is
frozen
music
<error>
is
the
saying
of
Frederich
Schlegel
<error>
And
if
this
saying
is
anywhere
significant
surely
it
is
so
in
relation
to
the
polyphonic
music
and
Gothic
architecture
<error>
In
each
there
is
the
progressive
playing
of
part
against
part
<error>
the
building
up
of
member
against
member
<error>
each
structure
completed
only
to
point
to
a
still
incomplete
superstructure
<error>
joining
in
the
endless
aspirational
upward
sweep
of
the
whole
<error>
Arch
rests
upon
arch
<error>
flying
butress
upon
butress
<error>
pinnacle
rises
above
pinnacle
<error>
-
-
everywhere
there
is
a
balance
not
quite
attained
<error>
a
symmetry
not
quite
perfected
<error>
-
-
and
by
and
by
we
realize
that
no
Gothic
church
can
ever
be
completed
;
its
beauty
is
its
eternal
promise
<error>
its
endless
upward
flight
<error>
Is
not
this
the
very
image
of
a
contrapuntal
music
<error>
and
of
its
supreme
expression
in
the
fugue

Since
writing
the

<error>
a
new
literal
translation
of
the
Sepher
Yetzirah
<error>
by
Mr
<error>
Knut
Stenring
<error>
has
appeared
<error>
I
quote
a
part
of
his
rendering
of
the
above
verse
<error>
since
it
includes
a
reference
of
great
importance
to
the
theory
in
hand
<error>
<error>
Three

-
Water
from
Air
<error>
He
wrote
and
formed
therein
twenty
-
two
letters
<error>
from
the
formless
and
void
-
-
mire
and
clay
;
He
designed
them
as
a
platband
<error>
He
hewed
them
as
a
wall
<error>
He
covered
them
as
a
building
<error>
He
poured
snow
over
them
and
it
became
earth
<error>
even
as
it
is
written
<error>
<error>
He
saith
to
the
snow
<error>
Be
thou
the
earth
<error>
(
Job
xxxvii
<error>
6
)
<error>
<error>
This
reference
to
snow
is
quite
startling
in
light
of
what
follows
in
the
present
treatise
<error>
Chaos
or
Matter
is
potentially
a
prism
which
refracts
the
great

becomes
organized

<error>
its

<error>
As
we
clarify
our
minds
they
become
as
living
<error>
organic
prisms
which
act
with
increasing
precision
and
detail
<error>
The
more
definite
and
authentic
our

the
more

the

they

s
work

been

my

He
writes

<error>
<error>
-
-
on
the
whole
all
plants
are
only
metamorphoses
of
the
Syngenesis
<error>
Here
is
united
<error>
what
in
others
is
only
blossoming
disconnectedly
<error>
The
importance
of
the
number
five
<error>
so
unchangeably
sacred
to
plants
<error>
will
yet
have
to
find
its
solution
in
the
Mathesis
;
without
any
doubt
it
lies
hidden
under
the
Dodecahedron
consisting
of
Pentagrams
<error>
as
the
crystallized
sphere

This
startling
confirmation
of
what
followed
upon
my
own
researches

After
mentioning
the

of
the
Tree
of

<error>
given
in
the
Sacred
Mysteries
of
the
Mayas
and
Quiches
<error>
Madame
Blavatsky
continues
<error>
<error>
This
represents
the
same
idea
as
the
Sphirothal
Tree
<error>
ten
in
all
<error>
yet
when
separated
from
the
upper
triad
<error>
leaving
seven
<error>
These
are
the
celestial
fruit
<error>
the
ten
or
one

ten
born
of
two
invisible
male
and
female
seeds
<error>
making
up
12
<error>
or
the
Dodecahedron
of
the
Universe
<error>
<error>
This
indicates
that
Madame
Blavatsky
has
an
idea
that
the
Dodecahedron
had
some
connection
with
the
Qabalah
<error>
but
evidently
no
comprehension
of
the
solid
prismatic
sections

necessary
for
the
building
of

The

lies

<error>
I
wish
she
had
said
which
Kabalists
;
but
the
cube
was
always
taken
as
the
true
symbol
of
Matter
and
this
obscure
reference
seems
to
indicate
that
if
one
understood
matter
<error>
he
would
discover
its

to
be
that
of
